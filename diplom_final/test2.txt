I am currently looking for a 3D graphics library that runs on MS
Windows 3.1.  Are there any such libraries out there other than
Visuallib?  (It must run on VGA and should not require any other
add-on graphics cards).

For Visuallib, will it run with Metaware High C compiler v3.0?  Any
email contact for the author of Visuallib?

Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

I am interested in any information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun

available to interface the system and whether the refresh rates are
sufficient to produce quality image representations.  Any information

It only falls apart if you attempt to apply it.  This doesn't mean that
an objective system can't exist.  It just means that one cannot be

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

I saw a Lifetime Medical Television show a few months back on travel
medicine.  It briefly mentioned some drugs which when started two or
three days before getting to altitude could assist in acclimitazation.

Unfortunately all that I can recall is that the drug stimulated
breathing at night???  I don't know if that makes sense, it seems
to me that the new drug which stimulates red blood cell production
would be a more logical approach, erythropoiten (sp?).

Alas, I didn't record the program, but wish I had, since I live

Please let me know if you get more informative responses.

When I owned an SE, I replaced the fan with SE Silencer, available, I
believe, from MacWarehouse or MacConnection.  It comes with instruction for
installation and requires no soldering.  Worked like a charm.  I think the
manufacturer is Mobius.

There is a similar statement attributed to Anselm, "I believe so that

Subject: Re: Sphere from 4 points?
Organization: TNO Physics and Electronics Laboratory
Lines: 26

There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as 

   (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2

This equation can be rewritten into the following form:  

   2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1

For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.

In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.

The best fitting sphere will have 
- center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)
- radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).

So, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?.

If a person gives a well-balanced reasoned argument, Tammy, then all are
happy to discuss it with him.  If he makes astounding claims, which are not
backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them.
If the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not
supportable then people would have simply ignored him.  He did not.  He
claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed.  His argument was for
christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe
him and his message.  I for one will not take things as read.  If you told me
that pink fluffy elephants did the dance of the sugar plum fairy on the dark
side of Jupiter then I would demand evidence!

Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me
included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and
started to experience these problems.

Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of
potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware
(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power
manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.

None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe
(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I
have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears
to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on
startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is
being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any
non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be
reset by "holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up" -
Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button
I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if
someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.

Beyond this Apple suggest that " you should follow the technical
procedures to check the hardware of this Duo". Since so many others
appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there
has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -
and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230
purchasers who have this problem.

Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,
particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)

I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after
I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training
day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of
the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale,
and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that
heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few 
minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with
chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But
I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued
arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my
usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of
the day.

My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --
my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal
and it is no longer cold. 

Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through
my brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise
regimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar
cause these symptoms (I hope)?

Has this happened to anyone else?
Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  Does it come with age?

Thanks,
Tom

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs
for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down
to zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and
it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.  This
sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable
factor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't
all the way hard OFF.

It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an
interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to
the original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer
to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, "The Bible, the
Qur'an and Science") for in general his translations are more literal.
 
Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing
as 

"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion."

(Also note that "the celestial bodies" in the first translation quoted
by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in
the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.) 

>Perhaps someone who can read the original Arabic can eliminate one of

>impressive.

You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.

However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a "Dr.") thinks it is
significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even
though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.
(And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750
verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)

I want to convert a 500 Volt sinewave with frequency between 1 kHz
and 10 kHz, to a 10 Volt sinewave with the same frequency, by
means of a transformer. The secondary current will be .6 A (600 mA).

What kind of transformer should I use (ferrite?)
Can I buy one? If so, I need a partnumber and supplier
If I cannot buy one, how do I go about winding one myself?
What core do I use, how big must it be in order not to saturate,
what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.?

I know little about analog electronics, so I hope some kind
soul here will help me out.
Pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated.

I must agree.  There is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups
already.  In addition, there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories.

Also, it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with mega-crossposting; thus the group-split
would not, in all likelihood, bring about a more structured
environment.

I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye. My right eye tends
to cut out when I look at distant things, my left eye when I am close
up.  I had specs to balance things up a bit but could do without them.
I thought that, one way or another, I would always be able to see
clearly.  Unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head and I can
no longer see close up objects clearly.  Maybe it's just that my arms
are getting shorter :-)

  I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a "deterrent" to crime. If so,
why doesn't every crime carry a death penalty ? That would be effictive
wouldn't it ???

  The death penalty is a punishment, much like a $50 fine for speeding is
a punishment. Anyway, somebody with murder on the mind doesn't much care
about the consequences. I think another problem is that people dont think
they will get caught. If I wanted to kill another person, I wouldn't 
care what the penalty was if I didn't think I would get caught.

  If it was to be strictly a deterrent, it should have been more along 
the lines of torture.

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here,
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.

    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side.

and it has since turned out that all the mirror sites I looked at were 
fooled by a restructuring at the original site - zaphod.ncsa.uiuc.edu -

Indeed, CDs are bundled with it.
You usually get nine CDs with demos of applications, games, photos, etc.

I have compiled a list of these and posted it to alt.cdrom.

Subject: Home-made IR remote extender
Organization: Memphis State University
Lines: 19

Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:

  I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is a 
little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. Then
I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works
like a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are
relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with
my Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's
VCR, it didn't work.
  The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a
Sony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD
player...

	Any advice would be appreciated....

The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie

SF (and I"ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is 
usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's 
decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story 
disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and 
sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.

Organization: chevron

 I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.

 About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes
 under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement
 of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of
 the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced
 the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor 
 suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.

 While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being 
 manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently
 increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (
 palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part
 the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had
 been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the
 pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is 
 persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3
 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides
 minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  

 My questions are: 

     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the
     levels of pain?

     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?

     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?


  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.
  
  
  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup
  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.

From my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature,  I think that the
benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to
other kinds of risks.  (This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan
grilling.)  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  This MAY make sense because vit. C
is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the 
chemicals in question.  Bon Apetit!

I guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).

Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and
Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do
the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your
printer ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work
well enough for your purposes.

Hope this helps

You've got the oscilliscope, so you connect it up to the sensor wire

Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.
It's small enough that I will attach it.

I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB
cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to
40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective
difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better.  I do not have an FPU.

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.

If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to
see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called
"Performance Rating" numbers by themselves are of no interest. 

Cheers.

You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put
it at a convenient number like "1".  You *could* cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the
hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive.

Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM
SIMMs, though.

You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer.  The relevant parts are:

  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate
  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25" device mounting bracket]

Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to
mount a 5.25" device.  The service techs I talked to said, "Oh sure,
we stock those."  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard 5.25" device.  (Why not?  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for
their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device.

Good luck with your SyQuest.

You were right the second time, it is KNX. Believe it or not, I also
listen to KNX in the evenings here in Colorado! It's kind of fun driving
through the country listening to traffic jams on the 405. Back to your
original question. Yes, there are sensors just past every on-ramp and
off-ramp on the freeways. They're the same sensors used at most stoplights
now (coils in the pavement). You might want to give CalTrans a call or
even ask Bill Keene (KNX's traffic reporter). I doubt if just anyone can
get the information, but it would be worth asking just in case you can
get it.

Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully
up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different
manufacturer's synonyms):

------
In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view
of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my
views on things like availability and backward compatibility):

74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively
	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball
	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.

74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher
	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.

74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.
	Very obsolete; use CMOS.

74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in
	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.

74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower
	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of
	devices.

74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high
	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.

74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things
	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.

74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly
	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.

74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with
	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer
	CMOS 74 families.

4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS
	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low
	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.
	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,
	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).
	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The
	clear choice when speed is not important.

74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power
	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for
	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.
	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of
	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power
	consumption at faster speeds.

74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read
	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility
	in CMOS involves some compromises.

10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources
	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for
	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow
	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,
	can be expensive.

100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and
	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.

As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and
74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices
you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just
have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible
with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of
hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.
10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.

Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are
interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.

:) No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. I
didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it
really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. 

Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp
thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under
the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day
vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  
is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease 
on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating
meat).

Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm
water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it
softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with
oilyness. 

Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any
prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of
pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't
be an infection afterwards.

Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry
makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an
incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).

Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio
filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio
oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.

This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove
noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is
available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  Note that
this is for communication applications and is not "high fidelity".

I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate
some net.wisdom.

His question is about some 18-24" diameter balls which are attached to
electric power lines in his area.  He's seen up to a half dozen between
two poles.  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution.
My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
inductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles?.

Anyone know what they really are?  Is there a related FAQ for this?
Is there a better group to submit to?

We'd both appreciate some enlightenment.

I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed
succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz). I have tried
clocking my FPU at 28 to 50 MHz and it all worked just fine. I have a
MC68030-33 CPU. I don't know why my FPU has an XC (my original 33MHz FPU
was label MC68882-33), but it seems to work fine on my system. Maybe you
just have a bad chip.

Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups.

Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post
them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has
been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the
alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles:

   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers
   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism
   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument
   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources

This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The
others are entirely optional.

If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work With
the Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"
and "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questions
concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.

   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up
   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
   problem.

3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].
   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest
   versions of the FAQ files there.

   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you
   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to
   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with

      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq

   in the body.

4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article
   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these
   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.

5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
   consisting of the following lines:

      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources
      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq
      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction
      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic
      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources

5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of
   the following lines:

      send atheism/faq/faq.txt
      send atheism/faq/logic.txt
      send atheism/faq/intro.txt
      send atheism/faq/resource.txt

   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.
   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and
   "send atheism/index".

6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the
   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this
   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to
   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.
   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,
   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have 
   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.

This is also commonly seen in new teachers.  The first few years, they're

common.  Come to think of it, I was about my healthiest when I was

Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,
outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In
this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point
of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,
then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which
may make you headache.

The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the
successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then
it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.

My experience tells the second method is relible.

Hope this helps.

Candida albicans can cause severe life-threatening infections, usually
in people who are otherwise quite ill.  This is not, however, the sort
of illness that you are probably discussing.

"Systemic yeast syndrome" where the body is allergic to
yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine.  There

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.

There are several public domain utilities available at your usual

We'll let you live, but just this once....

There's more to a real "storage" scope than just a long-persistence
phosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all;
what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,
which becomes charged as the electron beam intially "writes" the trace.
With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level "flood"
electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
which are next to the "written" areas on the storage screen.  There are
some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage
tube, and the stored trace tends to "bloom" with time. 

Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current
digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a
frame-buffer memory anyways.

Why do you think he would be called a quack?  The quacks don't do cultures.

	Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape
is harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are 
very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While
there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to
get your hands on and costs quite a bit.

	If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an
NTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by
modem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, this
would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy
animation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.

	Otherwise, see if your local public access cable

My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112

I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there
are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.

My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "back

particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any
current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a
normal IF filter can be used?

Any suggestions?

The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:

I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the
equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).

The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has
a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an
entirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the 68000.
Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with
snap on upgrades:  the 68000's "legs" will oxidize, causing 
unusual system errors.

Well, that's me.

So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be
fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and
modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of
is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't
acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on
the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.

Will someone provide the extra 3%?

The equation of the sphere through the 4 points (x1,y1,z1),...,(x4,y4,z4) is
  | x^2+y^2+z^2  x1^2+y1^2+z1^2  ...  x4^2+y4^2+z4^2 |

  |      1             1         ...        1        |
When this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the
equation in the form
  A(x^2+y^2+z^2) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 0
If you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be
zero if the 4 given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete
the square on x, y, and z to obtain
  (x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 = r^2

The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational
attitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s),
and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their
assumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's a
lack of consistency here.

Now I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God
does not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational
people have problems with that "logic"?

But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.

It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was
that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who
they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or
hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's
still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also
because people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he
had wrought.

First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not
sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?

One of the big reasons is that many, many people want something
beyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I for
one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.

And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.
Can love as a truth be proven, logically?

John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see
how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast
in this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,
I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,
you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,
Jesus, for instance.

I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence

love as truth is subjective.

My query is:
	I have a HP workstation: HP Series 400 with X running on it.
I have a true color - 24bit color monitor connected to this machine.
Normally I have the capability to display 256 colors from a max of

million at a time. 
Que: do we have a facility in X(c-function call) that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen? I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of 256 colors.
Que: If not. Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls?

We are generating ray traced images and 256 colors are indeed a
painful limit. besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification.
Please, if anyone can help i'd be obliged

The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not

finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons"

I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in
the next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a few
different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different
speeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when
I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any
compatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able
to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch
without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed
and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further
reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course
I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch
but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and
route it directly to the mother board.

I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know the
voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?  

Thanks.

Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the
reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to
heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the
resultant steam drives the turbines.

The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water
to continue the cycle

Subject: Cannot move data fast enough!?
Summary: disk -> buffer -> network card
Keywords: NuBus, SCSI, disk, throughput
Organization: Gokuraku Videos
Lines: 43

I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec
for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)

I have a Quadra 950. 
I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.
         (using block-mode transfers)
I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can
         achieve 6.8 MB/s.

Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.

It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,
then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s
result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)

So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, 

Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.
Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.
Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.
        ...
Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.
Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.

Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,
and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')
each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were
executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.

Why?

Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both
access data at the same time.)
Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use
the same bus to mac RAM?

Is there anything I can do?

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:

Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)

I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.

My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is
being a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,
other people shouldn't say so?  Can you give an example of a
commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,
or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
need to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of

      AH! But what, exactly, is "inherently abhorrent" and WHY is it so?
What you're saying is, in effect, "I think some things are repulsive,
and I know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me, so they
should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever, period".

      Which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent I agree with
you. But I do _not_ agree that things are 'inherently' or 'absolutely'
immoral; they are labeled 'immoral' each for its own good reason, and if
the reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label.

      No it doesn't. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all
belong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another
story altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence
to moral absolutism (of a flavour).

      You're saying morality is what'll keep society alive and kicking.
It is, I think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and
neither are their moralities.

      No, it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was "created

  Yes, E-Machines makes two mini-docks--the Powerlink Presente and the
PowerLink DeskNet. The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, 
including NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port
and a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.
  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of
these have an FPU.
  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes
me now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparable
video speed. No idea if it has an FPU.
  Hope this helps...

Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.

Don't quote me on that..... But I think I remember a BT engineer 
saying something to that effect when I was doing some work
shadowing a few years ago.

Byeeeee !

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that
something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently
don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing
cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests
are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the
video being piped into a command center they're building
somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or
cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large
multi-colored status displays will show the various routes
using different colors to represent the various average speeds
for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front
of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic
status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also
looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to
providing continuous audio from this system.

In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display
boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data
on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the
system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it
will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is
similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read
"cheap").

We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP
audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal
reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle
receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is
applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some
other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your
stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station
jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.
I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle
receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly
fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers
don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely
true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system
up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You
may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing
more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)

I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more
info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.

Cheers,
Alan

How do you calculate that figure? I'd assume even in personal computers
the board designers would use bank switching to (optimistically) 
quadruple the access speed  or am I missing something here?

  You missed the conspiracy by 1 step. Joseph knew who knocked her up.
He couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol' Mary prego. That
wouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles. So what 
happened is that she was feeling guilty, he was feeling embarrassed, and

At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the
strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism,
where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists
"believe" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a
valid one.

To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an
infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between
strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I
_logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am
a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To
justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that
the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny
is faulty.

If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god
(generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been
found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the
_real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been
found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to
base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.

I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome
(but perhaps we should change the thread subject).

No it in the way it is usually used. In my view, you are saying here that
driving a car requires faith that the car drives.
 
For me it is a conclusion, and I have no more faith in it than I have in the

No, that's a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually.
When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is
commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and
that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.
 
Interestingly, there are those who say that "existence exists" is one of
the indubitable statements possible.
 
Further, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is
already used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying
more with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far
are incomplete, making it a fallacy.

Where does that follow? Aren't observations based on the assumption
that something exists?
 
And wouldn't you say there is a level of definition that the assumption
"god is" is meaningful. If not, I would reject that concept anyway.
 
So, where is your evidence for that "god is" is meaningful at some level?

Why not die for a lie?  If you were poverty stricken and alunatic, sounds
perfecetly reasoable to me.  As to whether the societal dregs he had for
followers would be able to tell if he was a liar or not, not necessarily.
Even if he died for what he believed in, this still makes him completely
selfish.  Like us all.  So what's the difference.

There is no historical proof of this (see earlier threads).  Besides, he (or at

healing he gave.

I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect.
There is a "reasonable use" exemption for *copyright*.  There is none for
*patents*.  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work
is exempt but personal use is not.  That is, it's okay to experiment with
a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your
stereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.

Of course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected
or that you will ever be sued over it.

But, the goal need not be a subjective one.  For instance, the goal of
natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It wasn't
really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions
to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than
the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more
complicated than "the law of the jungle."  I don't think that
self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by
objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be
carried out completely.

It is all written in _The_Wholly_Babble:_the_Users_Guide_to_Invisible_
_Pink_Unicorns_.

To be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns, you must read the Babble,
and obey what is written in it.

To obey what is written in the Babble, you must believe that doing so is
the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns.

To believe that obeying what is written in the Babble leads to believing
in invisible pink unicorns, you must, essentially, believe in invisible
pink unicorns.

This bit of circular reasoning begs the question:
What makes obeying different from believing?

Don't be so sure.  Look what happened to Japanese citizens in the US during
World War II.  If you're prepared to say "Let's round these people up and
stick them in a concentration camp without trial", it's only a short step to
gassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally
only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly
because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation
caused by Goering's Total War.  Those who weren't gassed generally died of
malnutrition or disease.

(Disclaimer: I'm a sufferer, not a doctor.)

I'm not sure there's a really sharp distinction between allergic and
vasomotor rhinitis.  Basically, vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is
stuffy when it has no reason to be (not even an identifiable allergy).

Decongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis.  Also,
I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as
saline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel.

Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which
programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences
between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out
pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...

PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many
devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take
advantage of a 3D extension to X called "PEX".  PEXlib is a slightly
"lower" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX
extension to X.

Some advantages of using PEXlib...
- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS
- Provides immediate mode capabilities
- Is free of "policy"
- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support
  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).
  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.

Some advantages of using PHIGS...
- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones
- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output
- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier
- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you
- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.

If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like
archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that
both API's have a lot in common.

Dynamic RAM is not based on flip-flops; there's basically a single
transistor and capacitor to store each bit!  Static RAM is based on
flip-flops, and is much more expensive and much less dense.  And
neither has any parts that "move", if electrons and thermal expansion
are ignored...

Noooooooo!  I've been servicing Macs for years too, and I've had to
repair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way.  It's
rare, but it does happen.

Mind you, this doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  The parts that can
blow (the ADB power fuse and RF filter) aren't too expensive, so IF you
have a someone around who can do component-level repair, it may be worth
the risk (especially if you're around Seattle, 'cause you might get to
pay *me* to fix it :-))..  On the other hand, if your only repair option
is the Apple-standard logic board swap (major $$$$), you should probably
play it safe.

As you note, the research is mixed, so there is no consensus on the
role of fatty acids in Ulcerative colitis.  There is a role for short
chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches
that are inflammed (Short is butyrate and shorter).  There may be a role
for treatment of UC with Short chain fatty acids, and I am looking 
forward to the upcoming AGA meeting in Boston to see what people are
doing.  

You raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other
fatty acids.  You should contact the authors directly about that or
even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.  By the way,
the abbreviation EPA is not in general use, so I do not know what 
fatty acid you are speaking about.

And to Brian an U of C ---  There is a physician named Stephen Hanauer
there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of IBD.  You might 
give him a call.  He is interested in new combinations of drugs for 
the treatment of IBD.  If you call please say hello to him from me,
I was looking at U of C for a position, and perhaps still am.  And
be sure to look into joining the CCFA.

Best of Luck.

If you were omniscient, you'd know who exactly did what, and with what
purpose in mind.  Then, with a particular goal in mind, you sould be
able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance
with the general goal.

In an objective system, there are known goals.  Then, actions are judged
as either being compatible with these goals, or not.  Simple.  The problem
with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.  That is,
the goals of each society are different.

Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one.

But, we can enslave the animals, right?  But just not kill them?  Or

>So, are you a vegetarian?

No.  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant, anyway.

>Is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system?

Of course not.  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species
for food.  It might be nice, though, if the other animals were not made
to suffer.  For instance, a cow in a field lives out its life just about
the same way it would in the wild.  They seem happy enough.  However,
the veal youngsters aren't treated very well.

>How about an "objective" moral system?

I don't know.  What is the goal of this particular system?  There is no
inherent system.

>How about a "natural" moral system.

Nope.  Again, it seems okay to kill other species for food.

Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that
orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median
eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of
hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal
development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now
what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain
necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?
Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,
ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for
controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? 

How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to
"sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses
of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food
industry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine
and psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be
useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on
psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and
physiology.

I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities
(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its
implication for adults (me).  Certainly
the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than
for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious
and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their
hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone
want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the
endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*
attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.

Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some
sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally
administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone
fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant
supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient
release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is
responsible not only for control of growth during development, but
also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of
headaches? I don't know.

I don't think that's a problem.  My face is quite oily too.  I had a moderate
acne problem for many years.  I then found that if I vigorously scrub my face
with a nail brush and soap (Irish Spring) twice a day the acne was not a

Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert
unbalanced 1/4" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher
quality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from 
Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30.
You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear.
The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.

Hi!
A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII
in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time
was that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer,
I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought
in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down
converter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, can
be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really
trust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  Just 
wondering.

Yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared
for lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks).
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup
section says Apple 14" and 16" monitors can go on top, but 21" and other
big ones can't.  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load?

Now if I can figure out if there's any hope using the "partition" button
on the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?),
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly.  The "getting more information" section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn't mention the net.

   The following is from a critique of a "60 Minutes" presentation on MSG
   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS
   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]

	"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November
	3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In
	the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley
	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them
	('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently
	sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven
	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the
	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive 
	those studies are.

	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to
	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order
	to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,
	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as
	in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT
	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on
	humans but on rabbits.

	One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist
	Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that
	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get 
	headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably 
	overemphasized the extent of the problem.'

	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor
	at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley
	remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory
	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because
	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's
	research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human
	youngsters.

	In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's 
	experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected
	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing 
	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,
	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance
	to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither
	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG 
	with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by
	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little
	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human
	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations
	found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....

	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of
	that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific
	Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,
	have concluded that MSG is safe.

	Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never
	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed
	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a
	burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe
	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently
	exonerated the much-maligned substance.

	That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of
	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever
	we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one
	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken
	down into glutamate during digestion.

	It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the
	most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes
	up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in
	milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.

	That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number
	of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore
	sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international
	professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus
	reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large."

What I did NOT get with my drive (CD300i) is the System Install CD you
listed as #1.  Any ideas about how I can get one?  I bought my IIvx 8/120
from Direct Express in Chicago (no complaints at all -- good price & good
service).

BTW, I've heard that the System Install CD can be used to boot the mac;
however, my drive will NOT accept a CD caddy is the machine is off.  How can
you boot with it then?

Probably would not be fatal in an adult at that dose, but could kill

Note that "(the celestial bodies)" in the above verse is an
interpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator's 
(incorrect, IMHO) interpretation.

Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation (he studied Arabic for his
research into the Qur'an and science) of this verse:

"(God is) the One Who created the night, the day, the sun and the moon.
Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion." (Qur'an :33)

The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr. Maurice Bucaille is that
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for
a long time afterwards), there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
(or anywhere in the Qur'an).

Well, I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder.
For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain
blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually
performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made
clear in the below definition).

What do you mean by "reasonable?"

Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But,
even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can
still be deduced.

Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding
feud between two families which claim that the other committed some
travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family
kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified
in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this
sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't
like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family
goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there
is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty.
How do you resolve this?

Well, they are all murders.

Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your "problem," but
it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.

And, in any case, the nested "murderer" in the definition of murder
cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity.
And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the
first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily
a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently
unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the
information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.

To draw polygons of course.  Its a VGA mode 13h (320x200) game, done in C and

It isn't that rare, actually.  Many cases that are called Parkinson's
Disease turn out on autopsy to be SND.  It should be suspected in any
case of Parkinsonism without tremor and which does not respond to
L-dopa therapy.  I don't believe pallidotomy will do much for SND.

Hi... what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have (if
they want to go at least 9600 baud)?

Every place in town says they are back ordered, and part of the reason
I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
wherever I am, but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get
a modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud.

Thank you,

Keywords: ellipse


Hi! Everyone,

Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess
my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:

The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which
rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse
and its offset is same everywhere.

This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.
The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the
positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still
an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial
Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was
implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold
internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!
How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most
importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?

I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year
to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this
problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)
is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire
or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from
a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not
analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things
complicated. Please give me a hint.

I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.
However, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits".
Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

Please post here and let the others share our interests 
(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the
summary of the answers).

Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants
are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling
towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for
coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when
its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network
of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling
and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the
hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than
just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is
rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently
seen rising out of these towers.

That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because
it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of
the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.

The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam
system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the
boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across
the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and
by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it
back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference
(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage "hot"
turbine to final stage "cold" turbine).

Steve, take a look at what you are saying.  I don't see one construvtive
word here.  If you don't have anything constructive to add, why waste
the bandwidth - yeah, sure, flame me for doing it myself.  Is this
sci.med or alt.flame?  Like it or not, medical science does *not* know
categorically everything about everything.  I'm not flaming your
knowledge, just asking you to sit back and ask yourself "what if?"

Oh - and if you *do* want to flame me or anyone else, how about using

________________________________________________________


                                  So that the
                                  Prophecy be
                                   Fulfilled

                                     * * *

       In considering the Christian religion, and judging it
according to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at
fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps
the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in
the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main
strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even
about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in
the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the
authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at
least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much
happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we
will take particular claims at face value.

Immanuel:

       We begin, of course, at the beginning.

       (Mt 1.21-22):  "[Mary] will bear a son, and you,
       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is
       salvation), for he will save his people from their
       sins."  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had
       spoken by a prophet:

       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),
       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made
       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not
       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz
       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its
       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the
       lord G'd said to Isaiah, "go to meet with Ahaz..." 
       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,
       naturally) saying, "Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It
       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven."  But,
       Ahaz said, "I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a
       test."  Then (Isaiah) said, "Hear then, O house of
       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that
       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord
       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman
       is with child and will bear a son, and name him
       "Immanuel," which means, "G'd is with us."   He will
       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil
       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to
       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings
       you dread will have been deserted...

Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. 
Further, he the Hebrew word "almah," (young woman), as
specifically, "virgin."  But, this is not a prophecy about the
Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years
later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In
short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of
context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It
should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general
manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,
virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,
the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by
later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by
the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy
for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second
class prophecy.   Not too convincing.

Egypt:

       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a
quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he
wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an
alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.

       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of
       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:
       "Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son."


What the lord really said was this.

       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. 
       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called
       them (my people), the more they went from me; they
       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning
       incense to idols.

Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it
was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to
return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of
here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind
up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy
is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.

Rachel Weeps:

        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that
King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of
all young male children.  Matthew then writes,

       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the
       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:

       "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud
       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;
       she refused to be consoled, because they were
       no more."   

The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the
carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722
BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,
and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are "no
more."  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies
before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.
       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who
was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and
Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her "children,"
it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is
that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,
"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem)."
       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely
that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the
event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,
nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. 
Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less
evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a
prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance
the message of the church's gospel.
       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the
infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set
up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.
It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention
the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The "children" the prophet
speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd
comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be
returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this
would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are
dead for good.  Again, the "prophecy" Matthew sets up is not even
that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too
convincing.

The Nazarene:

       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find
another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife
take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, 

       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets
       might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."

First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of
the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who "He" is. 
There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,
there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still
worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at
all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that
she will,

       [Judges 13.5]  "...conceive and bear a son.  No razor
       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his
       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel
       from the hands of the Philistines."

This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. 
But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has
begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is
simple making them up now.

Bearing our
Diseases:

       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses
and disabilities.

       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the
       prophet Isaiah, "He took our infirmities and bore our
       diseases."

As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,
and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,

       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has
       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.

From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that
the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation
of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the
Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations
that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish
identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the
instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.
      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which
are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and
discipline.  They do not speak of a "servant" going around and
healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the
sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,
as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The
verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but
rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed
that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear
the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say
that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his
spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel
misses where he intended it to have its effect.


Silent Messiah:

      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus
ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse
the attention of the local rulers.

       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by
       the prophet Isaiah.   

       "Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,
       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on
       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He
       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear
       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised
       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings
       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his
       name."

The Isaiah passage quoted reads,

       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my
       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my
       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the
       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or
       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a
       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will
       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail
       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has
       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands
       await his law.

You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,
because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could
never think of Jesus failing, never would the "light" of mankind
burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to
an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace
G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will
be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed
from the Judaic "...the coastlands await his law." to the
Christologic, "the Gentiles will hope in his name."   While the
original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it
to fit its strange doctrine of "believing in the name."  If one
has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only
to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved
but blind and imperfect servant, "a people robbed and
plundered..."   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at
"prophecy" is examined, it crumbles.

Three Days and
Three Nights:

      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very
mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and
resurrection.

       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the
       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son
       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and
       three nights.

Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know
how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was
24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset
6pm.  What was referred to as a "day" was the period of light from
6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time
scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until
6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their
sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. 
(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that
Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,
when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight
portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,
Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise
unresurrected for three days and three nights.

      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the "ninth
hour," which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the
grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, "rose,"
before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was
over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for
clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before
6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm
Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means
using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two
nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this
is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we
are even able to have his death involve three days and three
nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to
suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little
mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his
god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more
than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.

Hearing &
Understanding:

     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in
parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if
you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the
message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the
parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand
them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not
accept the "plain" message any better.  Matthew says,

       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in
       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, 

       "You will indeed hear but never understand; and you
       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this
       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of
       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they
       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and
       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal
       them."

The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his
call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is
flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. 
Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,
calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.

       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, "Go, and say to this
       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and
       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this
       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their
       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear
       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and
       turn and be healed."  Then Isaiah said, "How long,
       lord?"  And he said, "Until the cities lie waste
       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the
       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far
       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And
       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned
       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still
       stands when the tree is felled." The holy seed is its
       stump.

Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel
to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the
promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read
the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan
of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look
at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)
     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion
of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,
he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't
understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are
not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the
present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. 

     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they
have the prophetic approval.

       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a
       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the
       prophet, "I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I
       will utter that which has been hidden since the
       foundation of the world."

Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a
prophet, but from the Psalms.

       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will
       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have
       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. 
       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to
       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the
       lord...

As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come
from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies
of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. 
Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some
of it up.
     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once
again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus
has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not
understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. 
Further, they speak of things "known, that our fathers have told
us."  Jesus deals with things "hidden since the foundation of the
world."  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. 
This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No
wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,
Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,
Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the
only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.


Excuses of
Little Faith:

       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go
around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what
epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were
possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were
unable to "dispossess" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more
enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying
they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this
demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or
he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move
mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can
move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the
Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to
Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old
woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.

       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in
ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their
sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in
heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and
their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  

     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time
or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the
old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the
theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see
God anymore.

       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're
       sinful; it's just his "plan"; we put too many of our
       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right
       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...

     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear
reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be
true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your
heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is
make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say
our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they
say, "See the love in these people you worship with... see the
lives of people change... that is seeing G'd."   Thus people get
lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday
sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is
not seeing G'd the way people used to see.  
      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of
human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the
forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created
by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are
what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody
has little faith.

Jesus Rides on
an Ass:

       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah
king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into
Jerusalem.  

       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken
       by the prophet, saying,

       Tell the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your king is
       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a
       ass-colt."

Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little
differently.

       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and
       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-
       colt... he will command peace to the nations.

There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah
only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the
poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for
both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a
comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two
donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,
proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written
earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to
Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and
shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has
bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I
have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,
the situation is often reversed nowadays...

       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were
angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,
Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,

       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of
       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'

It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus
was never one to point out such little "prophetic" things AND
since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to
fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or
Matthew, "Haven't you read?" for the source reads,

       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is
       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is
       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you
       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the
       enemy and the avenger.

The passages hardly need comment.  There is no "perfect praise"
spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,
not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be
just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic
scripture.

YHVH said to 
my lord...:

      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish
messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king
David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,

       "The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until
       I put your enemies under your feet."

Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic
descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of
course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to
make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine
nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one
is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. 
But, there are problems.
       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the
messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the
messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures
about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,
bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's
rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the
passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the
Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this
psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had
also made.  One must remember that there were various factions
among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the
messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like
his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and
who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.
What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,

       YHVH's utterance to my lord:
	"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your
       footstool."

       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule
       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer
       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the
       holy mountains.  

       "You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek
       forever."

The word "lord" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian
bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the
word is "adoni," and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means
"lord," a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in
the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an
address of respect.  
      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word
refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is
supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the
psalm translates to either "a psalm of David," or "a psalm about
David."  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court
poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the
psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be
talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended
from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive
tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any
praises of a messiah.
     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after
David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of
favour for David's kingdom on hold.  
     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was
promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,
successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved
the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,
enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.
      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,
though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though
his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this
event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off
a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,
though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of
Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. 
Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of
an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we
might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by
embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.

Moses & Jesus,
Had it Together
All Along...:

       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a
pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John
deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed
from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. 
But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early
church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah
king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made
by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of
a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this
was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the
Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the
fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the
promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.

       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,
       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.

It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,
Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. 
I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament
which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the
course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like
his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has
many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they
still cling to it.

The Potter's
Field:

      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by
one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,

       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver
       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief
       priests, taking the silver, said, "It isn't lawful for
       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood
       money."  So they... bought a potter's field with it to
       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was
       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,

       "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the
       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's
       field, as the lord directed me."

This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament
Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name
of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which
Matthew makes use of.

       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,
       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, "Cast
       them to the treasury," --the lordly price at which I
       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of
       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of
       YHVH.

First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer
of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely
a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people
shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with
one another.  The word, "treasury," had been replaced by the King
James Scholars with "to the potter," precisely because this made
Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The
correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed "treasury," which also
makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas "potter's
field" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was
intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given
Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of
intentional dishonesty.
      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the
text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if
as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard
the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to
toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah
directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high
priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the
treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the
opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,
the "prophecy" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New
Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing
enough.

Wine, Vinegar,
& Casting Lots:

      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.

       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,
       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not
       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they
       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that
       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,

       "They parted my garments among them, and upon my
       vesture did they cast lots."

First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour
wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find
that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him
some to drink --not polluted with gall.

       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, "I thirst."  A bowl of
       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the
       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he
       had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished;"

But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the
prophets, but one from the Psalms.

       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;
       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me
       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and
       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add
       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no
       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the
       Book of the Living.

Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request
of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm
quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It
is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that
we run into further problem when we see that the "Jesus" in the
psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the "crucifiers," whereas the
Jesus of the gospels says,

       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, the
       don't know what they do!"

Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by
having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his
meat, as the psalm stipulates.

       With the "prophecy" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally
ask, "What of the casting of lots?"  This brings up the 22nd
Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to
say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no
great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon
in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least
erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does
indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of
Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,
his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some
suspicions.

The 22nd Psalm:

      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his
condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of
praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it
seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We
will examine the primary passages.

       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! 
       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words
       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you
       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.

Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. 
This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather
than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not
fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as
complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like "the
lamb led mute before its shearers."  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much
groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by
both day and night on the cross.

       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... 
       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag
       their heads;  "He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let
       him deliver him... for he delights in him."

This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the
exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.

       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their
       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.

       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of
       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and
       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my
       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.

       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my
       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the
       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my
       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!

It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian
fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,
this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words "have pierced" really
do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,

       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of
       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my
       hands and feet...

In Hebrew the phrase "like the lion" and a very rare verb form
which can mean "pierced" differ by one phonetic character.  The
word in the Hebrew text is literally, "like the lion" (ka'ari),
which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal
imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that
would urge a Christian to change the word to "ka'aru."   But, to
add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the "prophecy" this is
just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the
correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to
Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the
translators.

       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend
itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being
saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the
psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know
that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather
the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional
thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on
his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.

      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not
attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord
Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all
the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and
interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these
scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down
is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian
theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful
fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might
have been "enhanced" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,
it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural
matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good
things for St. Matthew.

The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's
crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after
the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,

       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his
       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...
       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...
       "The will look on him whom they've pierced."

Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of
context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of
Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with
them.

       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...
       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations
       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will
       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on
       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have
       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him
       like you weep over a firstborn child.

John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that
Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more
than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and
blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel
writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their
religion were founded.


Reckoned with
Transgressors:

       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming
the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of
the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.

       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,
       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the
       scripture was fulfilled which says,

       "He was reckoned with the transgressors."

Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,
about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the
messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its
surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The
verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the
past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The
servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the
description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the
messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between
two thieves would fulfill the "prophecy" in Isaiah.  Jesus would
more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was
considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his
career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to
steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could
have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.

       Mark goes on to tell us how "those who were crucified with
[Jesus] also reviled him." [15.32]  This is to be expected from a
couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke
decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,

       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged
       with him railed, "Aren't you the messiah?! Save
       yourself, and us!"

This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the
people who crucified Jesus said, "Save yourself!" and that the
robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,

       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,
       "Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same
       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,
       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. 
       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,
       "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom." 
       And Jesus answered, "Verily I say to you, today you
       will be with me in paradise."

Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches
the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking
his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather
strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his
punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,
apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have
been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by
Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  
Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy
enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made
up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free
words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another
example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and
expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,
the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have
seen.

The End of the
World--
       Mt. 24:

       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and
embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all
three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most
unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus
mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and
his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world
which he has been warning about.

       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's
       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your
       coming, and of the close of the age?

       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for
       many will come in my name, saying, "I am the christ."  
       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for
       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,
       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the
       beginning of the birthpangs.
             They will deliver you up... put you to death,
       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.
       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This
       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a
       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.
             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the
       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to
       the mountains.

             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,
       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from
       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man
       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,
       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out
       his angels... and gather his elect...
             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its
       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know
       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these
       things, you will know that He is near, at the very
       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not
       pass away until all these things take place...
             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the
       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,
       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming
       at an hour you do not expect.

From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in
within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells
them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it
will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet
their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. 
But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his
disciples that their generation would still be around at the End,
and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be
swept away.
      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant
nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, "this generation
shall not pass away..." really means "this race of people will not
pass away..."  Of course, the word for generation is used many
times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. 
It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,
he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is
quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at
least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. 
The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking
at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from
Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus
meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.

       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th
chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000
years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,
hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. 
Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how
tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for
just the right moment to spring?


       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,
(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or
three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three
eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for
less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine
radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best
interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore
disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. 
As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when
people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,
Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have
seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout
Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple
belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with
argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away
from question.  To question and investigate has never been the
easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the
prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely
accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. 
Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity
have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support
wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which
Christianity can securely keep hold.

       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: "Don't think that I have come to
       bring peace on earth.  I haven't come to bring peace,
       but rather a sword."

I wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if I were you.  If you program

distributing the stripped version is well under a week.

Hardware methods prevent J. Random Loser from using his Copy II PC to pirate 
your software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough 
connections to "real" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your "check for the

You may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad
higher... a price change from $15 to $25 probably would turn off very few
potentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose
numbers don't change with the price).

As for the 20% pirating figure... ha, ha.  Of course, a lot of pirates just
have this "thing" about having pirated software, even if they never use it,
so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards 20%.  Even so, 20% is awfully
low.

Sure, you've already got the right idea.

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
the availability of parts.

Hows that sound?

					---Joel Kolstad

P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some
purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve).


Otherwise the other possibilities would be:

1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial
port on mac, collect data with some communications program.

2) Buy an A/D chip from Analog devices, Burr-Brown, etc, connect to
a parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition
(nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-)

3) Get a board from National Instruments, Data Translation, Omega,
etal.  The finest solution, but possibly the most costly.



To the original poster:  if the signal is too large, why not
use a voltage divider? Two resistors, cost very cheap...

A brain abscess is an infection deep in the brain substance.  It is
hard to cure with antibiotics, since it gets walled off, and usually,
it needs surgical drainage.

Imprecise. This description

 1. ignores the role of the ballast,
 2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.

The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts
short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less
heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to
the neon discharge.

The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually,
the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast
because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.

A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent
excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw
sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.

Undoubtedly it does, to maintain such a weight.  And it does so

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,
translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this
does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying
their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But
it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.

Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for
him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone
else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages
a court would award.

However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,
almost certainly it is "obvious to one skilled in the art" and therefore
unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)
cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.

Caution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if
significant amounts of money are at stake.

No, the argument says John has known Q, ie a codified version of the logia,
and not the original, assuming that there has been one. It has weaknesses,
of course, like that John might have known the original, yet rather referred
to Q in his text, or that the logia were given in a codified version in
the first place.
 
The argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion, but it fits well into
the dating usually given for the gospels.

Not necessarily, Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the
version given by Matthew. Improving on Matthew would give a motive, for
instance.
 
As far as I know, the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a
statistical analysis of the texts.

Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is
objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question.
It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--
realizing the risks--is to blame.

Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest of society because of this.

And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent
person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,
many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment
of innocents.

But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals
on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.

Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not
all such "murders" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life
is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?

But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an
innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of
society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder
include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an
execution, is it?

Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing
it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the
innocent victim is.

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction
was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth
matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That
is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.

But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the

Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all
possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our
flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,
but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if
we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.

>Now there's a huge difference.  If we can read minds, we can know,

But what we know has no effect on an objective system.

But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.
And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a
totally ideal and objective system.

Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.
We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to
the ideal system as possible.

True.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos
the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from
the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially
after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It
seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,
that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like
they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was "nice and clean" (smart
missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,
dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!

I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb
should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good,
inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back
for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.

Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan
was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,
the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's
ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.

Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US
and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other
back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't
care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured
in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to
Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion
by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil 
interests, caused us to take action.

I'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the

Are they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale

unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue
is in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but

No, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks

Germans, perhaps.  "Peers" doesn't mean "those who do the same thing",
like having murderers judge murderers.  It means "having people from
the same station in life", presumably because they are in a better
position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).

The media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing
liberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give
a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative
sources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)

Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people
if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and
there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then
innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say

I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain
and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That
conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.
And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't
mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as
being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of
an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed
necessary enough to go ahead with it.

But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I
don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult
decision under difficult circumstances.

You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.

Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to
those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply
refuse to condemn them for their decision.

even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of

same claim.

> 
> mathew

And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was
because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being 
"so deplorable".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a
decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,
precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big
stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians
(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing
in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some
civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than
any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives
with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories
of "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.
Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years
and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But 
we are expected to swallow that "hundreds of thousands" of 
*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with 
the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  
What hogwash.  If "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilians died, 
it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to 
the Allied bombing.

The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module
Device?).  A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server
models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the 
Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There
used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in
Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.
Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses
though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but
I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,
if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.

Ok lets have some calculation here: Going by Australian standards, which I

In Holland insurences pay for Homeopathic treatment. In Germany they do
so as well. I Austria they do if you have a condition which can not be 
helped by "normal" medicine (happened to me). Switzerland seems to be 
the same as Austria (I have direct experience in the Swiss case).

At the Univeristy of Vienna (I believe Innsbruck as well) homeopathy
can be taken in Med. school.

I found that in combination with Acupuncture it changed my life from
living hell to a condition which enables me to lead a relatively 
normal life. I found that modern medicine was powerless to cure me
of a *severe* case of Neurodermitis (Note: I mean cure, not 
surpress the symptoms, which is what modern medicine attempts to 
do in the case of Neurodermitis). 

I'm not saying that Homeopathy is scientific, but that it can offer 
help in areas in which modern medicine is absolutely helpless.

From reading your aritcle it seems that your have some deeply rooted
beliefs about this issue (this is not intended to be offensive or

I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I
originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This
was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.

Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is
powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given
the "no disk to boot from" icon.  However, upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  
Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power
off and on always works.

This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed?

I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to 
"come up to speed" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the HD?

Thanks!

If you could not tell which one had MSG, why restaurants bother to
use it at all? 

If you can taste the difference, psychological reaction might play a role.

The fact is, MSG is part of natural substance. Everyone, I mean EVERYONE,
consumes certain amount of MSG every day through regular diet without
the synthesized MSG additive.

Chinese, and many other Asians (Japanese, Koreans, etc) have used
MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand years. Do you believe that
they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes? Not. They just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth.

Baring MSG is just like baring sugar which many people react to.

No, there is something called the "Delany Amendment" which makes carcinogenic
food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the
1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased
detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.

This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very
weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are
banned.

This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a
time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,
and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.
This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.

If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone
would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates
that enforcement is still in effect.

An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as "gumbo file'".
This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This
is not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural
form, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption
was made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats.

Just a shot here, but ya never know:

I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

No, there's no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous.

The "evidence" is identical to the sort of evidence that has been
used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases
in the past.

I like the implication here.  It must not be that the quacks making
millions off such "diseases" are biased -- rather that those who
doubt their existence don't understand the real world.  It seems
easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same
thing.

However, I have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple
quack diseases rise and fall in popularity.  "Systemic yeast syndome"
seems to be making a resurgence (it had fallen off a few years ago).
There will be new such "diseases" I'm sure with best-selling books
and expensive therapies.

Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on
what you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good 
electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need
shielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic
fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,
like a Faraday cage.

The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,
you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.
You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a
real problem (one that bit me once).

Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,
your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and
then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your
equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to
switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,
as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.

Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you
lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to
replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and
you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.

Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that
AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to
be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.

Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back
in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they
did back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you
it'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul
everyone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.

There's been extensive discussion on the CompuServe Cancer Forum about Dr. 
Burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father 
to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma.  This disease is 
universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the 
tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum 
member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.  
He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from 
glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had 
audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.  
After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in 
September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his 
oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of 
shrinkage or necrosis.

The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live 
past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's 
treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's 
treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these 
treatments, saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a 
protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it, 
and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.  There is little 
understanding of the actual mechanism of activity.

	This is a followup post to something I've written previously.  Several

	I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host
via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require
about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots
of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be
interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it 
would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use
an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then 
transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM
needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes
to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).
Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for
this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART
built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a

Oddly enough, you don't, at least according to the wiring FAQ that
is regularly posted on misc.consumers.house.

A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents,
and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found.  No ground connection
is needed for it to function.

Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use
unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit
out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.

(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that
he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence
that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for
Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.
Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,
Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)

I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism
for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really
working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense
of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best
thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,
you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.
If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all
in mind, you will probably get nowhere.

>(Though why this critical
>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.

Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to
non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:
Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.

>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are

I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at
which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the
culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing
process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.

Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental
design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,
not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for
bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously
been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny
nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage
was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.

It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps
you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out
for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first
advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from
modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.

The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed. 
I don't believe the button un-dims, since there's nothing to select.  I
haven't tracked down a Centris to check this on though.

$50 each!!  Don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a

get higher end ones for more, but for PA use for bands, I wouldn't bother.

My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease -- a big

she should go off caffeine and chocolate for 6 months, as well as
stopping the estrogen she's been taking for menopause-related reasons.
She's not thrilled with this, I think especially because she just gave
up cigarettes -- soon she won't have any pleasures left!  Now, I thought
I'd heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health risk.
Is this accurate?  If so, why is she being told to make various

 Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and
subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that
once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added
to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We
would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for
further use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:

 (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize
precisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it's a compressed
format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the
offending header.

 (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would be
really nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;)

 I've already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain
graphics formats documentation, with no luck. So, if you know, or knwo
someone who knows - please email! Thanks.

Only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the
nature of the novel could think such a thing.  I'll accept it
(reluctantly) from mobs in Pakistan, but not from you.  What is
presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the
wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the
actual Mohammad.  What's worse, the novel doesn't present the
Mahound/Mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories
of Islam; in particular, there is no "lewd" misrepresentation of his
life or that of his wives.

>That is why

Don't hold back; he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer.
However, it's not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_, but for
what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is
contained in that book.  I have yet to find *one single muslim* who
has convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initially
claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book
than a superficial Newsweek story might impart, and all have made
factual misstatements about events in the book.

I'll keep an eye out for it.  I have a counter-proposal: I suggest
that you see the Viking hardcover by Salman Rushdie called _The
Satanic Verses_.  Perhaps then you'll understand.

Getting back to the original question in this thread:

I experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those

diabetes.  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from my
doctor, I think that the breathing problem was associated with the
presence of ketones due to the diabetes.

I think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting

You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "The
Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food," by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source
is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with
ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air
to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are
spaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.

Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use
your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may
not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or
racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my
oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a
wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows
for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it
often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are
using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway
through.

If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub
for this stuff.

All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).  While 
most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who 
are in "private practice" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their 
patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get 
your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for 
the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The 
better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's 
plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to 
control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and 
lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but 
I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For 
bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects 
are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing 
a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with 
inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet.

I saw this show a while back, and when I heard these kids

that quote about Jesus hating Jews (since Jesus himself was a

The jist of the passage (and I am sorry but I can't recall

the Pharisees for being corrupt.
Of course, the Pharisees were Jewish too, but it wasn't Jews
as a whole that Jesus was condemning, just the powers that be.

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting
on delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. Definitely needed the
heatsink. The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued
on a 90 cent Radio Shack sink. 

I made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrived
here. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user
slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly
a problem due to the CPU running too fast.

I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system
configurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used. I'd be happy
to coordinate and report results

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the
Baycom and my PMP modems)?  Ideally, something that is geared toward 
hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the
hundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).

I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.
Any suggestions?

        On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures 
the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 
5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish 
to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor 
only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
 
                What could the problems be and what else could I use
to lower the input voltage?  (btw I've got it grounded correctly)

It has always amazed me with the way the laws work.  It is not illegal to

The installation instructions are most informative and say, in full,

it six times for various and never the same problems.  Got tired of taking it 
back and fixed it myself.  The Hi-Fi "window" was a bit off.  Something like
the Hi-Fi audio fine-tuning.  When I was a Wal-Mart "associate" in '88-'89,
we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY.  How's that for
reliability?  Face it--Emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premium
quality), but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with 
reliability IMHO.  Please, no flames.  Just *had* to share my Emerson disaster

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with
"Kartagener's syndrome", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic
infections. "Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong
side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting
medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
by the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in
absence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situs
inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their
rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong
side). 

According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four
in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current
information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking
about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your
pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of
which there is probably one at NCSU.

Could you expand on your definition of knowing? It seems a bit monolithic
here, but I'm not sure that you intend that. Don't we need, for example, to
distinguish between "knowing" 2 plus 2 equals 4 (or 2 apples plus 2 apples
equals 4 apples), the French "knowing" that Jerry Lewis is an auteur, and
what it means to say we "know" what Socrates said?

none of the Vancanese, Beconase, Nasalide, Nasalcort, or Nasalchrom work 
nor do any oral decongestants work.  She replied that she saw an article on 
Vasomotor Rhinitis.  That this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing 
other than the Afrin's and such would work.  (Which in my case is true).

Please respond if you know anything about this and/or please let me know

I built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch

most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and

My question is:

	Is there a good relay/relay circuit that I can use for switching
audio, so that there will be *NO* noise of any kind on the audio lines.


I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also, exact part

What is the current resolution of SPECT imaging?  What kinds

could I hope
that SPECT could be used for, if its resolution improved,
say, to close to that of PET (Positron Emission Tomography)?
And how much does a SPECT machine cost?  How much does a single

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes
X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup.
You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the
serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted
onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does
something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative
prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely. I wonder
if ANYONE has ever managed to design a single sided PCB with an

Mac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and

stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while
some are "truly" mono (like the LC)

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is

and spend millions of dollars to simulate tornadoes. But tornadoes
do not require intelligence to exist.
 Not only that, the equipment needed is not really 'state of the art.'
To study the *products*, yes, but not to generate them.

It's not really their _decision_ to be tried. The rulings _do_ have
legal consequences, but only in Islamic law and not in UK law (this
should be obvious). Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making
of a judgment. Take for example the judgments of the World Court. This
is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no
physical or economic effect but which _are_ important despite the fact
that their judgments cannot be enforced

Of course, it is a sort of anarchism. Anarchism is explicitly against

My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our
first child (due June 15th).  We interviewed a young doctor last week
and were very impressed with her.  However, I discovered that she is
actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a "Doctor of 
Osteopathy" (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician
*I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from
any other doctor I've seen over the years.

My dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizes
manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought
to cause disease and inhibit recovery."

Jeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  I remember getting shots and
medicine from *my* pediatrician D.O., and don't remember any 
"manipulative techniques".  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to
the real, practical difference between an M.D. and a D.O.  Also, I'm
interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who
follows one or the other medical philosophy.

I believe that the "A-D converters" found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your
paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works
pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab
measurements off something as non-linear as that.

Hmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem
is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher
voltages would be more precise).

On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers
splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of
an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...

How do we come up with this setup?  Is this subjective, if enough people agreed
we could switch the order?  Isn't this defining one unknown thing by another? 
That is, good is that which is better than bad, and bad is that which is worse
than good?  Circular?

There are 2 books published by M&T BOOKS that come with C source code on

Programming In 3 Dimensions, 3-D Graphics, Ray Traycing, and Animation
by: Christopher D. Watkins and Larry Sharp.

Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C
by: Christopher D. Watkins, Stephen B. Coy, and Mark Finlay.

I have the first book and it is a great intro to 3-D, Ray Tracing and

I have only glanced at the second book but it also appears to be good.

Hope this helps!

How do we measure truth, beauty, goodness, love, friendship, trust, honesty, 
etc.?  If things have no basis in objective fact then aren't we limited in what
we know to be true?  Can't we say that we can examples or instances of reason,
but cannot measure reason, or is that semantics?

See, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here.  Earlier, you said
that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive
behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply
human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious
of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.

I try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.

And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be
defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  However,
it seems silly to talk of a "moral" planet because it obeys the laws of
phyics.  It is less silly to talk about animals, as they have at least
some free will.

I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the part
about the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that
the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
about killing Palestinians.  In retrospect, I can see how the
sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw
it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others
might see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit
strong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:

  #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it's a good idea to
  #do a little homework, or at least think.

was unnecessary.

Throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
anti-semitism.  If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech
on why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're
reading a lot into one flip sentence.  While probably not
true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets
thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the
state of Israel.

Anyway, I'd rather be somewhere else, so I'm outta this thread.

I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world
if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population. 
It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is
down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as
well post something new myself.

Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The
typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the
other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn
somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,
than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it
expresses its own selfishness.

Idle thoughts...

Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably
includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially
documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.

I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data
structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they
came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they
won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,
there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime
movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and
transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't
matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.

I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,
and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What
other patents does Apple have on the Mac?

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci, OH plant (Zimmer?) and
announced they were going to convert it to a coal-fired scheme, the
turbines were already in place, and they were the low-temp type. So the
plan was: Install a SECOND set of high temp turbines, and feed the
low-temp ones with the output of the new ones.

Never saw anything more on this. Did they ever really build it?

I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices!
I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price
was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I
tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a
resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard
number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could
not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA
over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT
EMPTOR.

However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist
- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably
get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order
out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains
to be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out
an educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO
include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!

Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the
rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe,
to treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--
a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd
had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,
I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active
ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical
sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.
The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in
human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the
reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.

This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's
little risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result.

I have ordered several Macs from different mail order companies with absolutely zero problem. You have to dig around to find the true gray market dealers that sell Macs with authentic serial numbers untouched. There are value-added dealers (nothing to do with VAT, no flame please) that are very legitimate.

CDA unfortunately is one of those that replace the serial number with their own to prevent Apple from tracing which authorized dealer sold that machine to CDA.

Nope, Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws.  The 
ethnic Germans who have lived in Russia for over 100 years 
automatically become citizens if they move to Germany, but the
Turks who are now in their third generation in Germany can't.
It's not a very good example to show citizenship without descent.

Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards
assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  Final
assembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.

The products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US;
by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcom
also tends to prefer American and European components over their
Japanese/Far East equivalents.

Off-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van
Alstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.

Of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you might
prefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...

The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the

is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)

The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately,

Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1,
but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes
channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a
channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many
sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.
Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the
only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
*undocumented* flag and modify it.

Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get
rid of the bugs.

Any better suggestions? (Silent games is not among the acceptab|e solutions.)

Subject: Advice sought: Turning font outlines into renderable polygons
Organization: CSRI, University of Toronto
Distribution: na
Lines: 53


I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or
TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted
by a 3D scanline renderer. 

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but
have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the
opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have
some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.

The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to
turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle
complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple
polygons). For example, in the letter "O" there are two outlines:

	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)
	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.

One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply 
connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the
two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a "polygon with
holes". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior
polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.

I do not want to use this simplistic system since:

	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple
		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for
		some fancy fonts).
	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.

From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid
decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as
is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal
polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.

My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into
polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution
since it creates excess number of polygons.

Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create
bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these
subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.

Thanks for any pointers.

That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching
Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this
highly-interpreted version is what was "enlightened for its times".
To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the
original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for
their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even
heard of paper.

I'm not arguing that the Bible is "disgusting", though some of the
history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is
full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are
worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand,
I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible
shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
to attack condemnation of the original history.

Does anyone know the details of the interface (5 wire din) for the
IR remote sensor & (2 wire IR repeater) for the ADCOM GTP-500II
preamp?  The ADCOM part numbers are the XR-500II, SPM-500II, and 
IRA-500II.

A cursory physical examination of the pre-amp connector indicates
that the connector (5 pin din) may provide: (Viewed from connector front)

I assume that the repeater connectors (mini-plugs) drive the IR repeater

I attribute my success to several factors:

Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,
I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I
estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.

Very little sugar or salt.

Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are
recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard
of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can
contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as
likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are
just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)

My "clean your plate" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last
10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch
up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.

I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry
shortly, and eating won't be practical then).

I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to
stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.
I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps
build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes
runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my
metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable
with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if
it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess
ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that
weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim
weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)

There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically
different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,
it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.

Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've
done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who
did try it and didn't succeed.

> I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large the
> fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.

I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.
I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,
my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes
off again over a week or two.

The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access
time, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course,
somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data
transfer rate.

All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer
rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment
about drivers.

Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice
feature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the
NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines.

The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics
chips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I'm a little
fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).

It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in
Santa Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal
Josephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We
got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec
(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)
... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).

Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.

CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime
does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated
above... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size
then it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The
price of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies
often, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick
on the latest 040 machines.

I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in
the 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?

You can probably get this information by calling your public health
department in your county (in Pittsburgh, they give the shots free,
as well).  There are bulletins in medical libraries that give
recommendations, or you could call the infectious diseases section
of the medicine department of your local medical school.  You also
will probably want to talk about Malaria prophylaxis.  You will
need your doctor to get the prescription.

I'm not sure about that.  Did you see the "poll" they took that showed
that most people thought physicians should be paid $80,000 per year
tops?  That's all I make, but I doubt that most physicians are going
to work very hard for that kind of bread.  Many wouldn't be able
to service their med school debts on that.  Mike Royko had a good
column about it.

Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my
new LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may
be a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. So
I'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figure
out what type of chip MacConnection sent me.

Each chip says: M518121A-80J
		 2515251

On the back of the card, it says 0593

I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figure
out what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful.
Please email me your response. Thanks a lot!

ALSO ... Nitrosiamines (sp) and sulfites...   Why them?  There are
 safer ways to preserve food, wines, and beers!

I think 
1) outlaw the use of these substances without warning labels as
large as those on cig. packages.
2) Require 30% of comparable products on the market to be free of these
substances and state that they are free of MSG, DYES, NITROSIAMINES and SULFITES on the package.
3) While at it outlaw yellow dye #5.  For that matter why dye food?  
4) Take the dyes and flavorings out of vitamins.  (In my OSCO only Stress

Good story, Chuck, but it won't wash.  I have read the NY Acad Sci
one (and have it).  This AM I couldn't find any reference to
"weight rebound".  I'm not saying it isn't there, but since you
cited it, it is your responsibility to show me where it is in there.
There is no index.  I suspect you overstepped your knowledge base,

For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    There
does  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  My current
episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  If  it's
bad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  However, my doctor
this time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to
protect the area.  Apparently the problem is not that common, but I'd be curious
if anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be
found.

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!
So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to
a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.

As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most
notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,
rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup
in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.

GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them
regularly (using the test button).

Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I
have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check
their common sense list.  Please exercise caution.

Hello,

I am interested in trying this "desensitization" (?) method
against hay fever.
What is the state of affairs about this. I went to a doctor and
paid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to the
diagnostic that I am allergic to (June and Timothy) grass.
I believe this. From now on it looks like 2 shots per week for
6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. Each shot costs
$20. Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system, I would
call that a racket. We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses
here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office.
Apart from this issue, I was somewhat disappointed to find out
that you have to keep getting the shots forever. Is that right?
Thanks for information.

Is that the low-end configuration?  If it is, it has the 68LC040 (no FPU), as  
opposed to all the other configurations with a 68RC040 (has an FPU).  Be sure  
you know what you are getting before you buy!!!  The 68RC040 is around  
$350-$400 right now, if you intend to upgrade it from a 68LC040.

I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or

the doctor administering it.  Is there also an anti-placebo 
effect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicine 
and therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the 
medicine?

Is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a 
medicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or sees 
more improvement than there is?  If so, what is this effect 
called?  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor 
doesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than 
there is?  What would this effect be called?  Have these effects

I've had PRK.

I would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. Mine said yes to
contacts. I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts.

No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to
8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress
chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the
cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't
cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.

I find my vision is more clear for some things, and less clear for
others, only at night. I notice a definite haloing at night in the
darkness when I look at automobile headlamps, though this is not
something I spend inordinate amounts of time doing. For ordinary
things, my vision, in particular having a fully-operating peripheral
vision, is clearer than with glasses, or contacts.

Perhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour

behaviour, entirely by chance.

Are you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an

     Hello, 

   Let me introduce a problem:

   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / 
   When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal 
to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.
   I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/
   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...
The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! 
   Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter 
actually measure? And what does it show?  

   Related question (less important to me):
   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
analog ones? 

   Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at

A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days.  I had the pleasure of
doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at
full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH.  Now if you go
a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of
it.  (If you speedo doesn't burn out.)  Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile
odometer would take 22 days or so.  Much easier just to take the speedo
apart.

Thought I'd share.  BTW, all this info was obtained legally  :-)

XC units are often pre-production sample devices.  Those are normally

Yep, that's for sure...that's one thing I like most about Motorola.

Check out the National Instruments NB-DSP2300. This uses the Texas

I have a new 25 MHz Motorola 68040 that I am willing to sell if I get
a good enough offer.  It is still in its static free sealed package.

If I don't get a good enough offer, I will use it to replace my 68LC040.

Any takers?  

Supposedly you can get one of these for $375.  However, at the moment the
demand is higher than the supply so I think $400 is a good round number.
I will pay shipping, of course.

All offers should be send to lewallen@cis.ohio-state.edu

Write a good manual to go with the software.  The hassle of
photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing
the package for only $15.  Also, consider offering an inexpensive
but attractive perc for registered users.  For instance, a coffee
mug.  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of
dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.

You're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use
are non-licensed users.

The best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into
your price structure.  Sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad.
Retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying
customers; the software industry is the same.

Unless your product is exceptionally unique, using an ostensibly
copy-proof disk will just send your customers to the competetion.

True, all you need to define is one statement that defined one

The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up A/UX and other
types of partitions. It WON'T let you create more than one normal mac
volume. You need SilverLining or something similar to do that. It WILL,
however, allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your

Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending
Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize
you.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using "petty sarcasm".  So
B.M. can have his "temporary atheists" whenever he needs them and all the
"temporary atheists" can later say that they were always good Muslims because
they never explicitly rejected Islam.  

Temporary atheism, temporary Islam, temporary marriage.  None of it sticks.

I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me 
that you're getting all wound up in a non-issue.  

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally 
occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food 
manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a 
known flavor enhancer. 

Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite, 
may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's 
added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their 
own appetites.

I also suspect, though it's been a while since I've checked ingredients 
on commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements 
on pet food additives than human.  

See, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence 
to look out after their own interests.

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking
about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).

If this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current
flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the
house are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires
unless there is a fault condition.  Notice also that in the breaker box
there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,
usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.

HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they
are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY
protein- because it's DEAD!  

Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be 
completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.  

Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.

My advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better
to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain
is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in
both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other
therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol
work better in migraine than tension-type headache.

The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got
relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than
migraine does not necessarily mean "psychogenic"; I suspect that
organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in
migraine.

Subject: Voltage Multiplier Problem.
Organization: Computer Science, Liverpool University
Lines: 53
Nntp-Posting-Host: goyt.csc.liv.ac.uk

Hi,

   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor
voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 
260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output
voltage as possible. (about 260v).
  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v
across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.
  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.
 If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will
increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.
These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of
them, So:

1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel 
with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?
  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase
the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...
as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out.

and
2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH
of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my 
dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not
playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long
run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

Email please.... Can't always read the net.....

Thanks in advance..

	Serum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.  Whole blood
	numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower (roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower).  I find the following range for whole blood in
	FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: N. W. Teitz, editor; W. B.
	Saunders, 1987:

	Human glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dL.

>Which are the strips calibrated for?  (Obviously they measure whole blood)

	Indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not
	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is
	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the
	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,
	however, results compare "reasonably well" with laboratory results,
	although "values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests,
	whereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic."

>What is the conversion factor between human plasma glucose and
>whole blood (pin prick) glucose concentration?

	As stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect
	whole blood levels, however.  I don't believe there is a well-
	defined "conversion factor," since cell metabolism will affect
	samples to varying degrees.  The serum/plasma test is much 
	preferred for any except general "ball park" testing.

Having been gone for 10 days, I'm way behind on my News reading, so many
pardons if I am repeating something that has been said already.

I read a good book while I was away, THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGS
ARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE, Stuart B. Levy, M.D., 1992, Plenum Press,
ISBN:0-306-44331-7.

It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  It
is interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers would
appreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of
understanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to
this particular information. I.e., it assumes you are smart enough to
understand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in
microbiology or medicine. Table of contents:

Chapter 1
	From Tragedy the Antibiotic Age is Born
Chapter 2
	The Disease and the Cure:  The Microscopic World of Bacteria and
	Antibiotics
Chapter 3
	Reliance on Medicine and Self-Medication: The Seeds of Antibiotic
	Misuse
Chapter 4
	Antibiotic Resistance:  Microbial Adaptation and Evolution
Chapter 5
	The Antibiotic Myth
Chapter 6
	Antibiotics, Animals and the Resistance Gene Pool
Chapter 7
	Further Ecological Considerations:  Antibiotic Use in Agriculture,
	Aquaculture, Pets, and Minor Animal Species
Chapter 8
	Future Prospects:  New Advances Against Potential Disaster
Chapter 9
	The Individual and Antibiotic Resistance
Chapter 10
	Antibiotic Resistance: A Societal Issue at Local, National, and
	International Levels.

Includes bibliography and index.

I personally found that it made very good Airplane-Reading.

I would suggest Draw for Windows (by Micrografx).  I have this on my
home box.  Its quite impressive and only cost UKL100.  It has a rather
nice clip-art library facility which you can expand with your own
drawings.  There is no circuit component clip-art included, but you
could add your own quite easily.

It works with any Windows printer driver of course, and can also
export embedded postscript and PCX files.

Note: I am not connected with Micrografx in any way.

Hey everybody:

   I want to buy a mac and I want to get a good price...who doesn't?  So,
could anyone out there who has found a really good deal on a Centris 650
send me the price.  I don't want to know where, unless it is mail order or
areound cleveland, Ohio.  Also, should I buy now or wait for the Power PC.

Thanks.

It  *is* relabeling ...

Krillean photography involves taking pictures of minute decapods resident in

First off: Thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the
68070. I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for
further enhancements to the Motorola line, rather than meted out to
another company. Ah, well, I guess that's what I get when I assume the
computer industry will operate in a logical manner! ;-)

Version 1.5 of Quicktime is, as has been stated, the current version of
the software. The older version is 1.0, and 1.6 is on the horizon in the
not too distant future.

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
does playing back resized movies. Apparently the process of expanding
each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
bit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work
pretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x
size or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.

(don't know

He lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by
the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the
same amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in
order to keep the sound and video synced up.

The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar
performance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I
was using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.
The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice
speakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,
the QT player Apple includes with the software.

>   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.

No problem -- it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the
things it does as well as it can.

I heard he had asked the FBI to provide him with a word processor.  Does
anyone know if Koresh has requested that it be WordPerfect5.0?  WP5.0 was

It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business 
or for an illegal use.  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or
police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no
other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. 

The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.
The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts
have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction
and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have
enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides
avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.

When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, 
explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an
association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector.
(I promise I am not making this up!)

I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any 
headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed 
laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund
raiser aspect of tickets.

Nntp-Posting-Host: aix02.ecs.rpi.edu

Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from
Mac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed,
and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in 
thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering
and fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one.

My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general?
Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this
a rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience
in this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of
experience.

That's about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary.
Thanks all.

Take a lemon.  Stick a copper strip into the lemon.  Stick a galvanized
nail in about 1 to 1-1/2 inches from the copper strip.  You should get
about 1/2 volt from it - enough to light an LED.

   Yesterday, I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the
University of New Hampshire. Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the 
(honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is
an atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov's funeral, Vonnegut stood up
and said about Asimov, "He's in heaven now," which ignited uproarious 
laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time
of the funeral)

	 "It's the funniest thing I could have possibly said
to a room full of humanists," Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture. 

         If Vonnegut comes to speak at your university, I highly recommend
going to see him even if you've never read any of his novels. In my opinion,
he's the greatest living humorist. (greatest living humanist humorist as well)

Hi,

well I have opened up a FTP site for getting the latest software drivers
for Genoa graphics cards.

Here is how to access it:

ftp 192.109.42.11
login:ftp
password:ftp
cd pub/genoa
ls -l
binary
prompt
hash

(now if you wanna have the latest drivers for the 7900 board)

cd 7000series
mget *

quit

This is the sequence to get the drivers.

If you have any further question, please email me.

First, thanks to all who replied to my original question.

I've implemented the ideas from the article above and I'm very satisfied
with the results. I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine.
In some cases (generating offset curves) loops can occur. I now have a
fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop. Although
I did not follow the article above strictly. The check if the fourth control
point lies in the the loop area, which is bounded by two parabolas and
one ellips is too complicated. Instead I enlarged the loop-area and
surrounded it by for straight lines. The check is now simple and fast and
my approximation routine never ever outputs self-intersecting bezier curves
again!

If you culture out the spirochete, it is virtually 100% certain

I've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory
upgrade.

I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi
at Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those who
purchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no
greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers
who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For those
who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi 
or greyscale (at 300dpi).

If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their
hardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance 
1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).

Regards,

Glenn

P.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  They
really have an obligation to provide this information to all
of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original 
configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for
things like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed, 
I'm going to write Apple and complain.

I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective, similar to
that used in Populous.  Basically, you look into a room that looks
similar to the following:

                             xxxx
                         xxxxx   xxxx

             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx
             x           xxxx    xxxx           x
             x       xxxx            xxxx       x
             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x
             xxxx              3 /|\         xxxx
                 xxxx            /~\     xxxx
                     xxxx            xxxx
                         xxxx    xxxx
                             xxxx

The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move
around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]

Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded
for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope
of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).

I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this
before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:

1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a
packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies."  I'm
now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).
Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,
thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?

2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort
the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.
Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared
shape?

Currently I take:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64

and produce:
            
             1  2  3  4
33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8
49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12
            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16
                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32
                                    61 62 63 64

Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.
Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.
This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But
it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?
Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap
already skewed?

Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?
I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.
Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.

[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)
*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to
be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside
of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.
This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to
change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this
approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough
distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in
a real perspective drawing.

Hopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches
hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

Thanks in advance for any help.

I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946,
then.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in
the employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities
refused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows
chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one
there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.
There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to
tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.

The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and 
exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The
facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians 
in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly
to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques
which were technically possible only recently.

The idea that "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi citizens died is
ludicrous.  Not even "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi soldiers died,
and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US
and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?
Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),
or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to
destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are
not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.
Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,
not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their
tyrant-dictator.

How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?
I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but
with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage
of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are
misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.
But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth
like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is
worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, "I know not what
course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me
death!"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one
wishes to stay free.

Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.
You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I
feel sure that was not your intent.

So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have
worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we
shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent
German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor 
French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We 
should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking
German instead of English right now.

Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand
diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is
that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so
now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to
mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait 
was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!

And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*
the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of "not guilty"?
Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those
policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.
But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I
have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a
trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply
lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind
which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends
to support in the case against the policemen.  

Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,
whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is
a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position
to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply
succumbing to verbal vigilantism.

Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the
Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in
particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions
are particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the
blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,
which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,
especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less
sensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,
on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood
levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release
of steroids becomes flattened.

                    Hope this helps.

The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal
heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias).  Some of them are very serious
while others are completely benign.  Having "a few irregular beats"
on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and
when they occurred, or could be of no significance.

Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying
heart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are
clearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem
low-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat
anyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level.

Actually, it is simple.

A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders
of X at the time when C was committed.  It doesn't matter if the physical
manifestation of C is outside X.

For instance, if I hack into NASA's Ames Research Lab and delete all their
files, I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom.  If the US authorities
wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law, they have no automatic
right to do so.

This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites
in Holland.  Holland had no anti-cracking legislation, and so it was viewed
as a "hacker haven" by some US system administrators.

Similarly, a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic
material which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting in
Britain, they would be committing a crime.  But they are not, they are
broadcasting from Denmark, so the British Government is powerless to do
anything about it, in spite of the apparent law-breaking.

Of course, I'm not a lawyer, so I could be wrong.  More confusingly, I could
be right in some countries but not in others...

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station
with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors
including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time
dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational 
equipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knows
where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a 
broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using
the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very
similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the
receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
unit.

The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series
of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will
use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately
305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals
on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers
correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system
which has stations all across the US.

The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.
Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.

Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist
outside the uteris.  Sometimes this causes problems, often it doesn't.
There is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are
causing other problems.  One lady I know had Endometriosis in an ovary.  
This caused her a _great_ deal of pain.  Another lady I know has an     
endometrial cyst in her abdominal wall; she is not having it removed.

The American Fertility Society has information on this and they probably 
maintain a list of physicians in all parts of the continent that deal with
endometriosis.  You can reach them at:

My wife breast-fed my three boys 12 months, 16 months, and 29 months
respectively and they are 18, 16, and 10 years old respectively.  So
far everybody seems fairly normal.  I noticed a negative correlation
with ear infections and length of time nursed in my very small sample.
I do notice that the 16 and 18 year old seem to eat a lot, could that
be from the breast feeding :-)  ?

I don't understand the "unfit mother" charge other than any tactic is
not too low down for some folks during divorce/child custody battles.

Most of the developing nations practice breast feeding to 3 and 4 years
old.  Are they screwed up because of it ?  Would they be much better
off if they could use cow's milk or commercial formula ?  Doctors ?

	Ask the practitioner whether he uses the pre-sterilized disposable
needles, or if he reuses needles, sterilizing them between use.  In the
former case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles.  In
the latter case it's highly unlikely (though many practitioners use the
disposable variety anyway).

Scott,

I don't have to make outrageous claims about religion's affecting and
effecting history, for the purpsoe of a.a, all I have to do point out
that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate
atheism. At no time have I made any statement that religion was the
sole cause of anything, what I have done is point out that those who
do make that kind of claim are mistaken, usually deliberately. 

To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to
misunderstand human nature, the function of religion and of course,
history. I believe that those who distort history in this way know
exaclty what they're doing, and do it only for affect.

Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I

is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.
 
Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows

It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil

is another evil.

The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known,
the course of events is fixed.

And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said
something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have
what you define as free will.
 
Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them.
Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence
of good as evil.
 
But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.
Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you
have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

That the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys

And a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god,

Blue lights. Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the
spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).

possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people
with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up
most of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things
to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not
work as well, if it worked at all. (lecture on basic atomic physics
fits in here, about electron transitions (quantum leaps) and stuff.

Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly. However, "decibel" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is
right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.

Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,
hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).

The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,
but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)
All the other units were defined many decades earlier.

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because
of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for
other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy
and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were
killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions 
lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,
peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to
mind...

I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers
of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally
intended for.

That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is
just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in
the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in
religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many
people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own
stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to
kill by their leaders.

The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often
lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant
side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching
between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  

@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest
parts of Man's history.@

Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological
social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.
The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups
with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to
further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these
were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious
persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more
powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples
because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over
religion that he does not have many choices.

Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of
little silver butter-dishes.

But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal

Good point.  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to "circle
the wagons" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless
(maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence
to support controversial subjects, such as the "yeast hypothesis").  But
evidence is evidence - it requires a "jury" or a process to sort it out and
determine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better
understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating
illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not
worthless.  Rather, it can help focus limited resources in the right direction.

I think APDA has something called MacWireFrame which is a full

I think it weighs in at $99 (but I've been wrong on an order

Add me to the list of bugged 230 owners.

I had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 when
I first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  Finally it "died",
wouldn't start, until I  opened the docking door (which snaps open) and 
the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  Apple 
replaced the processor board.

Now,
  twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action)
  twice the machine has refused to wake up.  Acutally, the backlighting
    came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in
    (but not with a good battery).
    The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery
      for ~1 minute brought the machine back.
    The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until
      powered down for about 30 minutes.  The screen had what looked

No, I say religious law applies to those who are categorized as
belonging to the religion when event being judged applies. This
prevents situations in which someone is a member of a religion
who, when charged, claims that he/she was _not_ a member of the
religion so they are free to go on as if nothing had happened.

This thread seems to be arguing the validity of a religious viewpoint
according to some utilitarian principle, i.e. atheism/religion is
wrong because it causes death.  The underlying `moral' is that death
is `wrong'.  This is a rather arbitrary measure of validity.

Get some epistemology.

But now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way,
and I don't think you've even noticed.

In another part of this thread, you've been telling us that the
"goal" of a natural morality is what animals do to survive.

But suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long
term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some 
other species, either terrestrial or alien.

Does that make it moral to do so?

Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. 

Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one I
noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD
capability refer to the "auto inkjet" feature. This should have read "auto
inject" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from
Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess
that someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo and
changed it to the more familiar word "inkjet".

Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of
*writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)

The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by
the European partners of Motorola. It has some integrated I/O controllers
and half a MMU, but otherwise it's a 68010. Think of it the same as

SUIT is available at suit@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu
I have binaries of RTrace with SUIT for SUN Sparc, SGI Indigo
and DOS/GO32.
Please contact me if interested.

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie
and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of
proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, 
almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable?
Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save
another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?  
That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, 
especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable,
the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line,
those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be
able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial
killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his
own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence,
it is.

>>>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.  And, I thought I had

Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because
it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.

Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.

Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you
include that?

The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the

with that?

If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as

fiction, as I do in reality.

Sounds like euphemisms to me.  The difference seems to be, that objective
is some reasoning that I like, while arbitrary is some reasoning that
I don't like OR don't understand.

Yeah, but the problem with holding up the "extra-rational" examples as
exemplars, or as refutations of well founded methodology, is that you
run smack up against such unuseful directions as Lysenko.  Such "extra-
rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.

I sure did use version 3.2. It works fine with most software but NOT

There's a pretty good article in the the March 6, 1993 New Scientist titled
"Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil".  The article states that research
has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the
disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with
AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement
seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients
who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.

I think you are too optimistic! PostScript is a very big language and
so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of ANY arbitrary
ps code. The only program I know to manipulate PostScript files is
IslandDraw.
I for myself use xfig and include the PostScript files (converted to

So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of

Exactly why science uses mathematics. QM representation in natural language
is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical
terminology. Nor is it supposed to be the truth, as opposed to the
representation of gods or religions in ordinary language. Admittedly,
not  every religion says so, but a fancy side effect of their inept
representations are the eternal hassles between religions.
 
And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will
be agreed upon as being similar. Show me something similar in religion.

With the effect that the models presented are useless. And one can argue
that the other way around, namely that the only reason metaphysics still
flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified -
showing that it is bogus.

Ben,

Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works,
the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough
cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of
the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their
stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different
position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of
contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing
the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the
ball, not the center cylindrical area.

I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but
needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our
office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one
could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might
help.

I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If
you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl 
alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.

If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see
if it is actually causing the axle to spin. 

If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(
It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be
necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that
dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

Hope this helps,

Murray

Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor?

Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife.
I took him to a local "Urgent and General Care" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The 
clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the 
doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not 
see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed 
here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several 
trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:
	- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,
	- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going
	  to the emergency room;
	- the doctor would not even speak to me;
	- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;
	- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I don't know."

I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but
I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to
be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still 
trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a 
letter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.

I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,
to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.
You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When
someone calls this number, your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings.

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.
A device would measure the length of rings.  When it
detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.
Five rings later your fax picks up the call.

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80
switches now available.

But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new
# to my friends and customers.  This should leave the
old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the
phone when I hear the long rings.

circulates through heat exchangers that recondense the turbine
exhaust back into feedwater for the heat exchangers that transfer
energy from the reactor's cooling circuit.

The reactor has a closed loop circuit to prevent radioactive

The cooling tower is a separate circuit to avoide contamination of

Purifying boiler feedwater is important business at both fossil
fired and nuclear generation facilities.

Hi,
I am not sure where to post this message, please contact me if I'm way off
the mark.
On 19.3.93 my wife went to her General Practitioner (Doctor). He mentioned
an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us. He had
read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again.
The article was about Whiplash Injury/Cervical Pain. It mentions the use of
a MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagery) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work
of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain.
This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal. I very much
want to obtain the name of the article, journal and author because the case
matches my wife. We would very much appreciate anyone's help in this matter
via email preferably.

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable
contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no
visible contrast bands.

To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,
etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these
frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote
directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.

Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?

This sounds wonderful, but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing
this, or they don't have the power to do so.  For example, I would like
to see a comp.graphics architecture like this:

comp.graphics.algorithms.2d
comp.graphics.algorithms.3d
comp.graphics.algorithms.misc
comp.graphics.hardware
comp.graphics.misc
comp.graphics.software/apps

However, that is almost overkill.  Something more like this would probably
make EVERYONE a lot happier:

comp.graphics.programmer
comp.graphics.hardware
comp.graphics.apps
comp.graphics.misc

It would be nice to see specialized groups devote to 2d, 3d, morphing,
raytracing, image processing, interactive graphics, toolkits, languages,
object systems, etc. but these could be posted to a relevant group or
have a mailing list organized.

That way when someone reads news they don't have to see these subject
headings, which are rather disparate:

System specific stuff ( should be under comp.sys or comp.os.???.programmer ):

	"Need help programming GL"
	"ModeX programming information?"
	"Fast sprites on PC"

Hardware technical stuff:

	"Speed of Weitek P9000"
	"Drivers for SpeedStar 24X"

Applications oriented stuff:

	"VistaPro 3.0 help"
	"How good is 3dStudio?"
	"Best image processing program for Amiga"

Programming oriented stuff:

	"Fast polygon routine needed"
	"Good morphing alogirhtm wanted"
	"Best depth sort for triangles?"
	"Which C++ library to get?"

I wish someone with the power would get a CFD and then a CFV going on
this stuff....this newsgroup needs it.

Beware.  There is only one such *copyrighted* image and the company
that generated is known to protect that copyright.  That image took
hundreds of man-hours to build from the source satellite images,
so it is unlikely that competing images will appear soon.

Looking at historical evidence such 'perfect utopian' islamic states

start an Islamic revolution and create this perfect state, it takes

I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home
medical tests currently legally available.
I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where
feasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or
more and allows the patient some time and privacy to
consider the best action from the results of such tests.
In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic
tests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease,
should be offered free to the American public.
This could actually help to reduce national medical costs
since many would have an earlier opportunity to know
about and work toward recuperation or cure.

This example is probably wrong.  There is the case of one famous

I had the same problem with my 512 a long time ago.  Resoldering
the joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it.  Turns out
that continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped)
cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video
circuitry off.  If you're not a solder-jockey you might want to
have someone else do it -- I took mine to an electrical engineer
buddy -- but it was a 20-minute job, tops.

What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by "omnipotent"
that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates
a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively
useless.

To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean "being all-powerful" and
not "being able to do anything/everything".

Let me illustrate by analogy.
Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose
further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any
nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country
at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the
US see fit.  The US would be militarily "omnipotent".

But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not
interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current
civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.

Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to 
unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But
effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy 
of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to
strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would
ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it
could actually do, although it had the power to do "whatever it wanted".
The US would simply "never want to interfere" for such an idea would
be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate
non-interference policy.

God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but
He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what
He, Himself is.

I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning
omnipotence.

Regards,

Jim B.

So, you consider the german poster's remark anti-semitic?  Perhaps you

I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
be carcinogenic that "it would not be legal in the U.S.".  I think that
naturally occuring substances (excluding "controlled" substances) are
pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives
or other "consumption".  It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an
ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they 
really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything.
How in the world do you suppose it's legal to "consume" tobacco products
(which probably SHOULD be banned)?

Of course, if you're planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring one's
leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's
other plans.


In Rushdie's case, the one under discussion, one can. It is tragic that
in _some_ "Islamic" countries this is so. There are, however, Islamic
countries (whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is
to be incorporated), e.g. Kuwait, where one can freely make such
statements without fear.

This story has become tiresome. The conditions are clear. If you care to
make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made
public statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of _TSV_. If
he did make such statements then he should have made _that_ clear rather
than trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal
feelings.

OK, I don't use CView anymore, but I saw that no one had explaind this
"bug" in the thread, so here goes:

It is NOT the fault of CView.  It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a
floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes
that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT
from the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,
and has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.

The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave
files open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).

I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which he 
claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti-
cancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that his 
work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable 
responses of his subjects during clinical trials.

What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  He 
paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an 
intolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge 
his claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department of 
Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's 
work.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a 
treatment that didn't seem promising.

Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
status of his research would be appreciated.

Though I can't imagine WANTING to have intercourse during a full-blown
yeast infection :-) chances of it being transmitted to the male are quite
low, especially if he's circumcised.  But it can happen. 
At one point I was getting recurrent yeast infections and the Dr suspected
my boyfriend might have gotten it from me and be reinfecting me.  The
prescription was interesting.  For each day of the medication (a week) I 
was to insert the medication, then to have intercourse.  The resulting 
action would help the medicine be spread around in me better, and would 
simultaneously treat him.

The best way of self injection is to use the right size needle
and choose the correct spot. For Streptomycin, usually given intra
muscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot on
the upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). 
Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Make
sure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when the
needle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it 
pierces the skin).

PS: Try to go to a doctor. Self-treatment and self-injection should
be avoided as far as possible.

Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors

Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically
tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle
berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in
such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, 
Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle
berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids 
(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste
sour as well.

Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a
diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin
pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such
substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.

A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.
We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted
extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We 
awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]

There is no click, since I put a .1uF cap across the LED.  Distortion
measurement are very low with mic level, and they went up to 0.03% at a

of the balanced line.  No hums, pops, just audio jumping out of silence.
The FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150-200
ohms with it on.

just a suggestion:
take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
secs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock
input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'
gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart
cycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then
goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..
these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt
gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.
Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3" or 4" of foam or build a box
of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...
build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery
and ckts warm.
2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.

Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL
rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction
in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..

hope this helps

Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.  As a result mail order
companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.

This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have
more machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs
by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better
wholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial
nunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.

You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.

I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices
thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer
cost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs
and trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well. 
The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest
prices available from authorised local dealers.

They are even further away from educational prices.

A book that I can somewhat recommend is :
                     
                     Pratical Image Processing in C
                     by Craig A. Lindley
                     published by Wiley

It addresses reading/writing to/from PCX/TIFF files; image acquisition, 
manipulation and storage; and has source code in the book. The source is 
primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities. I 
have converted some of it to Quick C. Naturally, the code has some problems 
in the book - as usuall. Typos, syntax, etc. are problems. It can be a good 
learning experience for someone who is studying C. There is also a companion 
disk with source available for order and $50.00. Overall, the book is not 
bad. I acquired the book at WaldenSoftware.

Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so a
switch isn't going to help them.  If you aren't using your com ports for
anything else, just define them on different com ports.  Define your internal
modem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3.  You really
shouldn't have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you won't be using
both modems at the same time :).

The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing
rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it doesn't itch.

The rash  always comes on the day after the
fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever.
It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current
town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever:
a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever
seems to bring rashes that go away faster.  

Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an 
embarassment, but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying
some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out
its competition?

	The reason I'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to:
1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might
   have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with
   it or actually having this disorder ) and
2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated
   with seizures over the internet.

Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours
after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston
and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.
This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in
learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with
hospitals, procedures...etc.

I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed 
quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight
as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs
and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal,
but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests,
body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not
know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot
of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where
we stand right now....

If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above,
any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing
from you. I am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gather
information about it. As I know now, these particular types of disorders
are still not really well understood by the medical community, and so I'm
going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle
insight. Thanks.

I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion. I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went
with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered
lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that
meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce.
I thought, "Well, I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor,
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch
another scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance.

Hi there
I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present.  Although it's shown as a
chronic & rare tissue disorder, it is thankfully NOT life threatening.

The very worsed thing that can happen to a non-treated sufferer is
glaucoma.  My specialists are bombarding me with Prednisolone E.C. (a
cortico-steriod) and after four months at 20mg a day, it's totally done
away with my enlarged lymph glands, so somethings happening for the
good!

Cheers Nigel

The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  The cockpit
crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew
limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time
on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.

The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military
aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably
pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members
DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.

Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have
big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But
if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an
airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.
Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and
anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can.
Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.
Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies),
yawning--these will help all four causes.

Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??  If not,
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
box. If you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill
for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. Are you sure that what you
are doing is on the level. Sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
at somebody's unlisted number.  Fess up.

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.

When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the
National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,
it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you
have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead
gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know
the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.

The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for
example.

;No breeding, no "hybrids", etc.  The ethical question is, should

Two past problems with eugenics have been 
1) reducing the gene pool and 
2) defining the status of the eugenized.
 
Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted
genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to
crowd out "garbage genes." This may in the future become possible. Even if
it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully
mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy
later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa
and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We
don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The
reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred
domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,
meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,
etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible
available is a good strategy for species survival. 
 
Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out
as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make
"philosopher-kings" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)
want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their
kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually
realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,
it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen
to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing
new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before
"1984."   
 
I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2
problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to
use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That
hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which
have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also
many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own
power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the
fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their
turns came.
 
Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off
the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global
warming or whatever could and may still do that, too. 
 
The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think
man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any
better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we
may not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of "garbage" people out
in some backwater with otherwise long discarded "garbage" genes which will
pull us through. 
 
I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.
Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his
lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,
and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God
in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue
needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have
died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough
input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed
themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the
ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit
to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes
thus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. 
 
In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new
technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in
some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the
Spirit.
 
Sorry for the long post. Got carried away.

On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for
use with the curses library.  Guess what they provide? :-)

Unix Press, ie. Prentice-Hall, has a programmer's guide for these
tools, referred to as the FMLI (Forms Mgmt Language Interface) and
ETI (Extended Terminal Interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  It is
ISBN 0-13-020637-7.

Paraphrased from the outside back cover:

    FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,
    and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library
    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
    for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.

The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a
"shell-like" environment of the "fmli" program and it's database
files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.

The ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide
support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
with controls built on top of the curses library.

I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence, provided there is a lot of it,
and it is fairly consistent, will is very important.  First, it points to the
necessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects are
all psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  As I've pointed out 
before, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  One       
person's "make-believe" can easily be another person's reality.  Using 
psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations one
person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on
an acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going
to happen.  Anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully I made my
point- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting MSG
perceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience those
affects.  On the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  Still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that
leads to the study being done.

I have never been to Wisconsin, though I have been to
neighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA)
I found that there were few states in the provences that stood
out in this youngster's mind: California, Texas, and Florida to 
name the most obvious three.  However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin
stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have 
always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.
And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that
state's reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the
same.  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left
with me about their neighbors.

The only question in my head about Wisconsin, though, is 
whether or not there is a cause-effect relationship between
cheese and serial killers :)

I've been thinking of sending into Mad magazine an idea for a 
parody, of those books entitled "How Things Work" that
engineers buy their sons, which explain how engines, elevators,
flourescent lights, etc. work.

The parody would be "How Things Really Work."  Under "Canned
Food", on the left page you'd see the description from 
"How Things Work": gleaming stainless steel equipment
pasteurizing the food to precisely the right temperature,
then sealing the can in an oxygen-free environment, etc.

On the right page you'd see "How Things Really Work":
brain-dead workers sending disgusting food to the
gleaming equipment -- rotting vegetables, parts of
animals people don't eat, barrels of sugar and chemicals.

Under "Elevators" you'd see (on the left) computer geniuses
working out algorithms so that X number of people
waiting for Y elevators will get to Z floors in the shortest
time.  On the right, you'd see giggling elevator controllers
behind a one-way mirror in the lobby choosing which people
appear to be in the biggest hurry and making them wait longest.

In fairness, we should note that if you look up "speculum" in the
dictionary (which I did when this question first surfaced), the first
definition is "a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in
optical instruments."

Which doesn't mean the name fits in this context, but it's not as far

	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE
have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice
while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity
is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately
are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more
battery power.  

	Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they
are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.

I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection
between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on
the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on
the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware
ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing
has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.

In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides
are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the
PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.
When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.
I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the
transmission is error free.
But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.
Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human
typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).

I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files
from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please
tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am
talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some
kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.

Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because
of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds
because of some crazy reason I don't understand.

Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information
out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a
sys-ex dump?

Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.
I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,
or just me.

Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type
back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking
and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,
According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

Please help me figure out what's going on...

Good grief; has no one ever heard of Biostatistics??  The University of
Washington (plus 3 or 4 others [Harvard, UNC]) has a department and
advanced degree program in Biostatistics.  My wife has an MS Biostat, and
there are plenty of MDs, PhDs, and postdocs doing Biostatistical work.
People do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do
this sort of study well.

Anecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug
or treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised
at the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable,
reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.  

The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors,
and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I
would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS
student in a thesis.

I don't know about that...I've used Photoshop 2.5 on both a 486dx-50 and a Quadra
950...I'd say they are roughly equal.  If anything the 486 was faster.

Both systems were running in 24 bit color and had the same amount of RAM (16 megs)
I also believe the quadra had one of those photoshop accelerators.

That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.
Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser
gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers
who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on
self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the
data on computer disk.

The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will
notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called
a "bingo card" in the industry) includes lines for a company name
and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national
advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as
best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company
and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably
send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer
call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they
will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail
outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th
e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have
nothing to mail out accept the catalog.

A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry
magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They
use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read
the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push
you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile
how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.
This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that "23% of readers
requesting data were interested in capacitors." And finally, some
magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For
example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information
about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.

The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines
include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the
advertiser can attempt to cull out the "literature collectors" from
the serious potential customers.

"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could."

What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?

  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more
  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of
  weeks later.

  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want
  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also
  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually
  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data
  on a computer printout.

  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're
  not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every
  other month and circle two or three numbers.

  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.
  Advertisers almost never call.

You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make.
I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the
*process* of science and the end result.  

As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are
objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the
*process* of science.  

If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit
to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.
But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This
is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one
must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere
collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.

Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but
they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most
important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  
Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,
hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.
Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or
looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really
good thinking beforehand.)  

The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre
scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  
It depends on the quality of their THINKING.  

It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that
they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical
studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as
certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, 
but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  

And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that
science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding
mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.

I said that I PERSONALLY had other people order the EXACT SAME FOOD at
TWO DIFFERENT TIMES from the SAME RESTAURANT and the people that
ordered the food for me did NOT TELL ME which time the MSG was in the
food and which time it was not in the food.

ONE TIME I HAD A REACTION

ONE TIME I DID NOT

THE REACTION CAME THE TIME THE MSG WAS IN THE FOOD

THAT WAS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

SAME RESTAURANT - SAME INGREDIENTS!!!

I eat lots of Chinese food - I LOVE Chinese food.  I've just learned
the following

IF I get food at one of the restaurants that DOES NOT USE MSG or

IF I prepare the food myself without MSG or 

IF I order the food from a restaurant that will hold the MSG (and I
never get soup unless it's from a restaurant that cooks without the
MSG)

I DO NOT GET A REACTION!!!!

OKAY

DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!!!

I GET A REACTION FROM MSG

I DO NOT GET A REACTION WHEN THERE IS NO MSG

Ok, here could be the first question or answer or something:

Q: I want to copyprotect a program I wrote.  How should I do it?
A: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  You see, those 
   people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to 
   various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers 
   are good, and know the common tricks.
   So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.
   Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle
   for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially
   if there is some "key" item that can get lost.
   So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but
   would make life somewhat of a misery for them.



(This is my opinion, and I speak as a legitimate user :-)
You are of course free to have your opinion about this subject....

	Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two

appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered
the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.
He wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  They must
be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them
with!  

	Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  
Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first
time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected
(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been
pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!
	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've
heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get
it swapped.
	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This
wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location
of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for
these functions was much more convenient.
	Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.
I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...
	Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society
accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when
an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should
work to convince others.

And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered
the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept
the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely
going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of
what risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person
will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.

(1) No explicit (c) is necessary.  If it the image is attributed to the
Geosphere Company, then there is a likelihood permission is has been
given to reprint.

(2) Unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals.
However, "interesting" images do make their way into ads and
computer demos. That is when a pirate might get some flak.
This image is considered so "interesting" that many people would
like to use it whenever some global map is needed, so there
is lots of temptation.

(3) One mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery-
is not copyrighted, then the derived image can't be.  Not true.
A new, distinctive, creative expression of the data can be protected.
This image is certainly fits such, since NO ONE ELSE has taken the
tremendous effort to re-create it themselves.  Precedent is a recent
telephone book court case.  Ma Bell tried to copyright the data in
their books and prevent competitors from copying it (there are
trick entries in the book).  But the court only permitted copyright
of the expression of the data, and not the data themselves. (You cant
xerox and sell the telephone book.)

(4) There will be more attention to digital copyrights in the future
and computer becomes a mass product and moguls such as Bill Gates
are currently hoarding the digital copyrights.

(5) I'd prefer that Geosphere put this data in the public domain because
it is very interesting to me and others, but that's the way things are.

I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.
When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4
wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I
have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.

Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across
the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my
second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first
line. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second
line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the
red and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. 

Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.

Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in
from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and
went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read
open.

I'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?

Wrong...the major improvements for 2.01 and 2.01a are in the use of IPAS routines
for 3d studio.  They have increased in speed anywhere from 30-200% depending
on which ones you use.

All the Yost group IPAS routines that you can buy separate from the 3d studio
package require the use of 2.01 or 2.01a.  They are too slow with 2.00.

Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp
out level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big

bounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching

Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.

I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service
lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.

They need a hit software product to encourage software sales of the product,

There are some multi-media and digital television products out there already,

counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups.  I see in your posts a 
spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don'
t believe exactly as you do.  If you're here to try to convert the atheists 
here, you're failing miserably.  Who wants to be in position of constantly

So far I have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard,
but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split.
However, when I learned typing in school some years ago, I was taught
to write 'b' with my right hand. Is this a difference between Danish
and American typing, or what???

Thanks a lot in advance!

It is a wonderful meter.  Several colleagues here have some of the

I've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep

More interesting only for your propaganda purposes. I have said several

Yes, but if you upgrade the VRAM in a 900 you get 24 bit color.  So
you really don't care.  My point is that out the box the 950 has
more video capability for the same size monitors.  The 900 can

Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always
see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many
fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination.

The Fluke 87 beeps at you if you try to take it out of a current measuring

That means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  It does
not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime
in the first place.

The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually
stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other
capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death
penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from
committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.

This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent
(short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what
about the case of the innocent executed?

And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the
death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on
the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial
punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the
strongest argument to make.

I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide
for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement
for capital punishment.  Those who don't want to live the rest of
their lives in jail would always have this option.

Quadra 950. Unfortunately, the 950 has only one ADB port and
it seems I would have to give up my mouse.

Please, can someone help me? I want to use the tablet as well as
the mouse (and the keyboard of course!!!).

Thanks in advance.

It also gave me lots of problems with joint and muscle pain.  Seemed to

Wrong.  That was exactly the issue.  Go back and read the context

Now that I've done you the kindness of responding to your questions,

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV.

   Well, if that's the case in YOUR practice, I have a hard time 
   figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
   of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons?
 
   If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,
   they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
   treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for
   fraudulent purposes.

   OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 1984
   ran the heading: "Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable by
   Drugs or Surgery," which has been echoed by several other reports.
   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, since
   the 20% magic of the "placebo effect" would award alternative 
   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine...

Hi,
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being 
fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100
packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed
testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).
Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds.
 
	Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge
of this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/
names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages
would help. 
 
P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit
of overkill(?)

>So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had "different

Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in
the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of
religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a "real"
story (that is, a bigger headline).

Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the
various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the
Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the
standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has
obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.
These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and
to the Septuagint.

Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:
first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are
variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to "fixing"/predating
the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of
my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and
have little theological import.

The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of
Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There
is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no
sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the
septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations
between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the
septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the
differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big
expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the
material, but so far this hasn't happened.

The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the
OT, unlike for the NT.

I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),
and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.

How about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting
ridiculous?

What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia.  Not  
only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  
observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
cases . . ..  No foolin!  He can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  
by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (Yes,  
I realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   
His ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  
living, I have heard . . ..

  If the emphasis is on the "in general", then of course you're
  correct, since you haven't really said anything.  If we restrict
  our observations to practiced religions, there are lots of
  examples of god mandated genocide.  Just ask the Canaanites.  The
  point is that if you believe in a god, and if you believe he has

  attempt.  After all, if it was OK in the past, it could surely be
  OK in the present.

All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my

the problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the
Quadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected

Subject: Need help with video detection circuit
Organization: Systems'n'Software
Lines: 55



I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to

Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill. 

Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whether
literature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original poster

Syndrome' is bogus.

Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question of
what effects MSG has. You could have real effects *and* placebo

Have you read Olney's work? I fail to see how citing results from
peer-reviewed studies qualifies as "bizarrely cracked".

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well. I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular.  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally. Some studies used IV and SC.
Intra-ventricular is not a normal admin. method for food tox. studies,
for obvious reasons. You must not have read the peer-reviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk.

Pardon me, but where are you getting this from? Have you read the
journals? Have you done a thorough literature search?

But, you're right, mice aren't the best to study this on. They're four
times less sensitive than humans to MSG.

The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids.
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.

Olney's research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount
of freely available Glu in mother's milk versus commercial baby foods,
vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed
foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.

 According to my TI databook, the pinouts for the TIL311 display are as
follows:
 
 Pin 1 - LED supply voltage
 Pin 2 - Latch data input B
 Pin 3 - Latch data input A
 Pin 4 - Left decimal point cathode
 Pin 5 - Latch strobe input
 Pin 6 - Omitted

 Pin 13 - Latch data input C
 Pin 14 - Logic supply voltage, Vcc
 
The logic supply voltage is 5V @ 60-90mA. The LED supply is also 5V, but
it need not be particularly well regulated. The LED drivers on the chip
use a constant current source, so LED intensity is not affected by the
supply voltage.

If I remember rightly PKU syndrome in infants is about 1/1200 ? They lack
two genes. And people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1/56 persons?
Those with PKU have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine. And those
who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to
be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame. 

The methol, formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heating?

I don't drink it. I figure sugar was made for a reason. To quickly and
easily satiate hungry people. If you don't need the calories it's just as
easy to drink water.  Used to drink a six pack a aday of aspartame soda. Don't
even drink one coke a day when sugared.

From: f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu
Subject: Disappointed by La Cie
Organization: Univ of Miami IR
Lines: 52

Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for
$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were
intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining
5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.

Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.
Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I
then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me
another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem.

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send
me a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.

I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these
facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data
recovery.)

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still
covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. 

I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La
Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.
But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent
a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)

What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any
other products from La Cie in the future.

Bill Krauthammer
f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu

PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service
has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like
that. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and
I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

Applied Engineering makes a NuBus card called the QuadraLink which is

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let me first say that "to believe that no gods exist" is in fact 
different than "not believing in a god or gods". 

I will argue that your latter statement, "I believe that no gods exist"
does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement 
that "no gods exist" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't  
know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then
(weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  
I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even 
after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.

But first let me say the following.
We might have a language problem here - in regards to "faith" and
"existence". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.
To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE
being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not
exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless
to debate the so called "existence" of God - and that is not what
I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of
being. When you say that "god does not exist", I also accept this
statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,
in what follows I will use the phrase "the existence of God" in it's
'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.
I would like a clarification upon what you mean by "the existence of
God".
 
We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what
Webster says:

faith 
1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY
b  (1): fidelity to one's promises
   (2): sincerity of intentions
2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God
   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion
b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   (2): complete trust
3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system 
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
of religious beliefs
syn see BELIEF



One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say
that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion
"based upon observation", I will have to ask "what observtions are
you refering to?" There are NO observations - pro or con - that
are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations
can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even
be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes 
partents "believe in God" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion
about the "existence" or "non-existence" of God requires a leap - and
you have made this leap when you actively say "I believe that God  
does/does not exist". Personally, I think that both statements are
misguided. Arguing over the "existence" of God is precisely the wrong way
to find Him (and yes, I use "Him" because a personal God is the only 
viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use "She" go ahead. Of course 
God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to 
anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be 
glad to.) 



And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently 
disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person 
thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think 
I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my 
ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  
thought out discussion.

			  While there may not be a part number for the CD300i drive, I have seen
a part number for the bezel kit (a new front panel with the slot in it
through which you insert the CD). The document (which I got from the
2/10/93 announcement at our Apple office) states the drive kit and bezel
kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of $149 fro the C650.
The external unit may be a better deal after all.

Apple doesn't make such a card, though I suppose a third party could.  One
big problem is that there isn't room for a standard NuBus card inside the

# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the

     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then
     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than
     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say
     "well, Satan is just metaphorical," but then you
     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is
     not some metaphor for something else.

     I say this because there are many, many instances of
     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in 
     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the
     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is
     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know
     one is metaphorical and not the other.

     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's
     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were
     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe
     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a 
     case where someone does believe in God, but by
     religious standards, they are "evil."  If Bobby
     does see this, let him address this question also.

This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series

Open it up and look for the power amp "ICs".  They'll be fairly obvious. 
Replace the one connected to the dead output.

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp
chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the
input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both
chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  

If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an
outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good
enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and
balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of
the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably 
before the other controls).  

If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should
probably forget the whole thing.

My company has developed an application for the Mac that emulates a chart
recorder - virtual pen traces scroll smoothly across the screen.  As we
tested the application on a number of computers we discovered some
surprising performance differences across products.  The scroll performance
of the IIsi and LCII was better than the IIfx. This led us to investigate
Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line.

The results:

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the
(drumroll please) LCIII.  And the Color Classic ranks right up there with
the Quadra line.  The Centris line pales in comparison.

Does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the
disparity in graphics/processor performance?

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a "boxer" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

Benedikt,

I can't recall anyone claiming that God -makes- anyone act a particlar
way, I think that you're attempting to manufacture a contradiction.
God is said to require certain behavior, but the only compulsion is
the believer's sense of duty. A standard of conduct does exist, but we
are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever
ways we find convenient, but our response to God's edicts can in no
way be used to question God's existence. The behavior of believers is
a completely separate question from that of God's existence; there is
nothing contradictory here.

To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really
asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All you
can really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself
is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).

Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief
than the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary
complexity. I think I know what you're implying, but I'd like to see
your version of this better alternative just the same.

	Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water
(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes 
through the cooling tower).  Third, liquid uranium would burst
into flame on contact with air.

Your doctor is right. It is best to do nothing, besides taking some pain
medication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect, or demand,
to have something done. In these cases some physicians will "tape" the 
patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe
an elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but the
patient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about the
problem. Either way, the end results are the same.

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line
looks better on low resolution devices.

The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They
also give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScript
environments where it is absent.

The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints
of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:

	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25
	
Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  From
reading I thought that what they might actually do is:

	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25
	
This results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" 
whichever is closer.

By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that
neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS
result looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if
anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.

Thanks,

In myopia the cornea is too curved.  There is too much of a bulge in the
center.

In PRK the laser removes a small amount of material from the center.

In RK the surgeon cuts incisions near the edge.  They heal, and the scarring
reshapes the cornea.

Entirely different mechanisms, and the action is in a different place.

Seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic

Sigh, it seems religion makes your mind/brain filter out anything

So anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the

NOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BI-DIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION.

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original 286s proves that.  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them R/W select line of the circuit to Vcc.  To make it bi ( which 
I did ) I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
the proper location.  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
Zenith ( they were not Zenith-Bull Group at that time).

Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened up
a bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest
topic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition
to the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may
take a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this
subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were
used to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty 
vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the
quotes they have.

At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings
about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians
"Creation Science" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history
of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran
to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too
easy to look at science as it exists today and then "interpret" passages
to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of
Nostradamus all the time.

Anyway, it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking.

Actually that is not how the pill works, but it *is* how the IUD works.
The oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occuring
by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland, and thus preventing
the LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation.  With the IUD
what happens is that fertilization may occur, but the device prevents
implantation within the wall of the uterus (*not* the vagina).

Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?

We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the
system, and lets crash the Mac then.

Okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate
errors in the 68000. Before every instruction some specified registers are
masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.

Normally, the "crash instance" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and
stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card
crash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the
card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.

The documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior
when crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing
the assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy.

So, can anyone help?
Please only reply via email, as I don't read this group.

Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you

mating practices, etc.  I don't think that these few cases are enough to

Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems
are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural
system is a subset of the objective ones.

I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although

homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean "bisexuality?"

But a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be

I was under the (possibly incorrect) assumption that most of the MSG on

I am one of those folx who react, sometimes strongly, to MSG. However,
I also react strongly to sodium chloride (table salt) in excess. Each

The simplest one is easy.  Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit, and
stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts.  The two strips must
be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc.  Then connect a voltmeter to
the contacts and read the voltage.

Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the

Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based. I'd be interested.

   My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it.
It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad
or video card is bad.
   I checked my monitor, it works fine with other Mac.
   I checked my video card, it's also fine.
   I replaced all the RAMs, it still didn't give me right answer.
   Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard.

   I don't know hardware architecture of the Macintosh.

   Can anyone tell me what's the problem ????

   It's a Mac IIcx.

  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"
with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're
better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator.

Ravi,

	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
vertical position.  If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   
I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  
why take that chance?  If you want more detailed info on the problem, please  
mail me at:===> sunnyt@dna.bchs.uh.edu <===.

Okay, I don't use it very much, but I would like for it to keep working
correctly, at least as long as Apple continues to make System software
that will run on it, if slowly :-)

Here is the problem:  When the screen is tilted too far back, vertical
lines appear on the screen.  They are every 10 pixels or so, and seem
to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus.
It looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection
between the screen and the rest of the computer.

I am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer,
or taking this one to the shop.  I would also like to not have
to buy one of Larry Pina's books.  I like Larry, but I'm not sure
I feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual
for it.

On a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to?

I'm not an objectivist, so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of
conceptualization.  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of
trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary
experience.  One can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from
the perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the
perspective of what's being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).

An analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is
that the "better" descriptive language is not available.

This word "reliable" is essentially meaningless in the context-- unless you

This supports nothing. I have no reason to believe that this is

I have no respect for titles, only for real content. I can look
up this article if I want, true. But I can tell you BCCI was _not_
an Islamic bank. Seeing as I'm spending my time responding to
propaganda (in responding to this little sub-thread) I really
don't feel a deep need to do more than make statements to the
effect that the propaganda is false. If someone wants to discuss

RIX's files with the extension  .sci and .scf are just a RAW file with

The first 10 bytes is a kind of header, with the name RIX among 7bytes unknown stuff. The you have 768 bytes of palette info (3*256 for the colors RGB)

Okay, this is a long shot.

My friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very  
regularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a  
number of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have  
said either "You have mono" or "You're full of it; there's nothing wrong  
with you."  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her,  
and one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome.

Now, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  
it exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the  
story?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be real?

Has anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live  
with?  Thanks for your assistance.

Warning of what?  In California there is a law requiring that ANYTHING which

foods, and even money cleaning machines (because Nickel is a mild carcinogen).
The result is that now nobody pays any attention to ANY of the warnings.

This is one of those sticky areas of medicine where battles frequently
rage.  With respect to your OB, I suspect that she has been certified in
ultrasound diagnostics, and is thus allowed to use it and bill for its

in fact considered by many to be the 'experts'.  I am not sure where OBs
stand in this regard, but I suspect that they are at least as good as the
radioligists (flame-retardant suit ready).

This is an interesting notion -- and one I'm scared of. In my
case I'm a Finnish citizen, I live in USA, and I have to conform
to the US laws. However, the Finnish government is not actively
checking out what I'm doing in this country, in other words checking
out if I conform to the Finnish laws.

However, Islamic law seems to be a 'curse' that is following you

According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator
can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus.
Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI
problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three
devices, fourth one causes major problems).

First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system.
If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine
then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this 
fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.

Hope this helps.

I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25"
mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First
there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't
figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the
bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?

Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are
a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.

Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to
work and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was
troublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on
the MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on
agian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.

It likely has nothing to do with "chunks of plaque" but it sounds like
you may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medical
attention *before* doing any more weight lifting.

So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is
if it contradicts the Quran?  What if it relates to something
that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran?

Also, the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed
either.  It wasn't long after, but 20 years or so is still long
enough to shift a few verses around.

From: banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu
Subject: How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation
Lines: 154
Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu
Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine

I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(
toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well 
because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got 
into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium 
would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.
But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 
supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).

Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams 
per day).

	1. Review Article "Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney 
	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.
	   5(3):110-129(1985).

But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both 
glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this 
production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, 
but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.

	2. "Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in 
	    patients with kidney stones" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)
	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary 
	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.

	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria" Clin. Sci. 38
	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day 
	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.

For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is 
required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for 
oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is 
quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  
The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% 
of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable 
and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 
6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic 
acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the 
extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a 
very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 
Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day 
increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg 
per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was 
increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose 
and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion 
before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average 
before supplementation.

B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There 
are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about 
yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the 
speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must 
have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then 
explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C 
challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your 
intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you 
take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient 
in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate 
kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets 
absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day 
showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309
-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase 
in urinary oxalate excretion.

	Here are the high oxalate foods:

	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.
	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams

	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, 
	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.
	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.

If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot 
of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points 
out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your 
intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being 
absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't 
have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for 
males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).
B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more 
per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  

The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day 
for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with 
this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 
requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that 
either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 
excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,
isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to 
supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that 
increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking 
birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the 
other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your 
dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone 
formation should be given B6 supplements.

One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your 
Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is 
calcium-oxalate.

	4. "The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of 
patients with calcium oxalate calculi"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)

	5. "Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the 
crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium 
interaction"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).

	6.Review Article, "Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment 
of renal calcium stones" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).

There are actually about three times as many articles published in the 
medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone 
formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in 
stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier 
post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I 
guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney 
stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought 
I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

	Harumph. Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something
to aspire to. :-)
	I can't really argue with your logic, though I think you may be
extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of
one. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is
not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who
treat Lyme disease.
	By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who
consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to
Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe
they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys
are, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for
what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.
	I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues
in Lyme, rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties
involved.

     "In Allah's infinite wisdom, the universe was created from nothing,
        just by saying "Be", and it became. Therefore Allah exists."
           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #1

     "Wait. You just said that humans are rarely reasonable. Doesn't that
      contradict atheism, where everything is explained through logic and
      reason? This is THE contradiction in atheism that proves it false."
           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #2

              "Plus, to the believer, it would be contradictory
                    to the Quran for Allah not to exist."
           --- Bobby Mozumder proving the existence of Allah, #3

and now

   "One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that say "Mom",
    because of the love of their mom. It makes for more virile men. Compare
    that with how homos are raised.  Do a study and you will get my point."
         -- Bobby Mozumder being Islamically Rigorous on alt.atheism

Mmmmm. Quality *and* quantity from the New Voice of Islam (pbuh).

While in grad school, I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with
"heat shock proteins". Apparently, burning protein will induce changes in he
DNA. Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion
I don't know, but I never eat burnt food because of this. 

Also, many woods contain toxins. As they are burnt, it would seem logical that
some may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I don't know if these
toxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsh
conditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to cross
the intestinal mucosa?

Maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almost
*anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that
may be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQ.

Jim,

There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread
that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can
be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need
for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is
no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is
determnined.
This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all
its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it
acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no
event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less
value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-
an event can have value. 
The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,
from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only
significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental
processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical
activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human
mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a
hill.
How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing
the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On
what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It
seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you
have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what
in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to
establish your values.
Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what
difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or
otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only
way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the
objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it
- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer
that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries
no weight in any "absolute" sense.
That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God
or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your
objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been
conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your
intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.
I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and
to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human
thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded
yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,
etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no
weight whatsoever.

The only fungus I know of from California is Coccidiomycosis.  I
hadn't heard that it attacked bone.  It attacks lung and if you
are especially unlucky, the central nervous system.  Nothing new
about it.  It's been around for years.  THey call it "valley

You are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on
TV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately).  Of course,
the phrase "TV screen" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates.  Might
even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).

Did you miss my post on this topic with the quote from The Indonesian

I will be glad to repost them.  Will you accept that it just may be 
a practice among some Muslims, if I do?  Or will you continue to claim
that we are all lying and that it is "not practised at all amongst Muslims".

I don't think F. Karner has to tell everyone anything.  Least of all that
he is lying.

Since you obviously know nothing about this practice, there is very little
you can contribute to the discussion except to accuse everyone of lying.
Perhaps it is your ignorance which is showing.  Learn more about Islam.
Learn more about Muslims.  Open your eyes.  Maybe you will also see some
of the things the atheists see.

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case
with no solution that worried me.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere 
that they are on the surface of.
Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the
surface of.

These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design
meet these problems neatly.

When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear
the algorithm should afil or return infinite R.
When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities
they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)
they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.

This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point
by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced

it can also be achieved by

If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. 

It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.
The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.
(4 points being colinear => coplanar)

Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points
has been found is trivial.

The argument goes as follows: Q-oid quotes appear in John, but not in
the almost codified way they were in Matthew or Luke. However, they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and
not an entirely different source.

We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual
explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider
their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke
that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).
 
As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence
for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.

That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.
 
The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?
 
One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.
Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.

In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like

A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has
emphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father died
of the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a very
occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tells
me this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthy
life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy
etc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know really
nothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lining
of the lung being able to exchange oxygen.  

Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  If he were to give up smoking
entirely would that better his chances for recovery?  What are some 
modern therapies used in people with this disease?  I would appreciate 
any information.  Thanks.  amigan@cup.portal.com

Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and
subsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to
chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is
something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much
more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an
autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which
also leads to cirrhosis.  

Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous
effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. 
Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,
among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic
circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of
hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. 
These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in
men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for
cirrhosis is liver transplant.

Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in
your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the
subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he
or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to
you, and offer you support.

I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say
what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say
how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for
months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are 
every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.
Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start
azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug
in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics
about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of 
disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it
is worth.  

I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good 
patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things
can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and
Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637

Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),

I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and
polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.

First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the
Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies
completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,
or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.

Now, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", so
this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is
to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to
solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.

In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe Systems
Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).

So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that
draws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By
"output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus
the original problem.

There are two small problems with this approach. 

	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the
	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of
	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of
	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.

	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the
	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in
	other words, will it halt?

	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is
	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn
	out to be undecidable.


I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite
precision and running out of ink, paper or both.

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know
better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known
Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.
37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to
Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an
acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no
longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)

From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)

Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its
second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that
deals with this).

Absolutely.  Unfortunately, most of them have had 3 weeks of neurology
in medical school and 1 month (maybe) in their residency.  Most
of that is done in the hospital where migraines rarely are seen.
Where are they supposed to learn?  Those who are diligent and

We are the only ones, sometimes, who have enough interest in headaches
to spend the time to get enough history to diagnose them.  Too often,
the primary care physician hears "headache" and loses interest in
anything but giving the patient analgesics and getting them out of
the office so they can get on to something more interesting.

I hope you meant "inarguably".

Subject: Disappearing hard drive in LC?
Organization: CONCERT-CONNECT -- Public Access UNIX
Lines: 31

The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to
hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system
7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated
chain.

I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes
have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking
question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed
okay, but there was no sign of the internal.

I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot
from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire
about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in
trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it
is a Quantum... )

Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I
noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that
all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.

But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD
or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.

And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I
can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed
there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and
that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.

Thanks for answers.

If you can get it, you might want to try a Canadian over-the-counter product

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?

Here is another anecdotal story.  I am a picky eater and never wanted to 
try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a
girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant
syndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different
dishes.  It didn't taste great, but I decided it wasn't so bad.  We went
home and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs.
I threw up for so long that (I'm not kidding) I pulled a muscle in
my tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and I'm
not allergic to anything that I know of.  

Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am 
physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*
a psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer
through beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.  
I haven't gotten sick yet.

    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is
no "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:
there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).
And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one
of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't
be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.
It's not an "option."
    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s
thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.

Hi there,

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for

has the message "fpu: optional".  I know from what we've discussed in this
newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80
configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their

I'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not.
Why say "optional" if it's built in?
Please, anybody help me understand this game.

Hi,

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, 
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!

	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,
Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:

	Ai [Current Gain]
	Av [Voltage Gain]
	Ap [Power Gain]
	or whatever.

I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but
I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? 
SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? 

	I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp 
models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High
power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than
I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me? 

I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help!
Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News... 
And I'll post if there's and interest!

As much as I considered some of the (so-called) Islam-related dialogue

instance, so, Gregg, try this:

20:52 P.S.T.  I come to my senses and accept the all-knowing
wisdom and power of the Quran and Allah.  Not only that, but Allah 
himself drops by to congratulate me on my wise choice. Allah rolls a
few bones and we get down.  Then Allah gets out the Crisco, bends 
over, and invites me to take a spin around the block.  Wow.

20:56 P.S.T.  I realize that maybe Allah is looking for more of a 
commitment than I'm ready for, so I say "Man, I've got some
programming to do.  Gotta go.  I'll call you."

20:59 P.S.T   Thinking it over, I renounce Islam.

BTW, Gregg, Allah said he still thinks of you.

Thus, a deciBell (deci-, l., tenth of + Bell) is a fractional part of the 
original Bell.  For example, SouthWestern Bell is a deciBell.

And the measure of current, Amp, is actually named after both the AMP company
and the Amphenol company.  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
were affected by the amount of current running through the wires.

The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers, thus
our use of the Ohms...

Organization: Virginia's Public Education Network (Richmond)
Lines: 27

Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in
defiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out
thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near
the Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radar
detector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would
imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a
radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!

As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law
against radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective
Jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector
accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.  

I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2
meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector
scream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the
brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)

Sorry for wasting your time with a probably simple question, but I'm not
an computer graphic expert. I want to read TIFF-Files with a PASCAL-program.
The problem is, that the files I want to read are in compressed form 
( code 1, e.g. Huffman ). All books & articles I found describe only the
plain (uncompressed) format. I don't know where to get the original
TIFF specification, furthermore I haven't any access to a realy complete
library. Can anybody direct me to a good book or (even better) to an

Yeah, the "Feingold Diet" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD
who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents
who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
children's development.  So much for the value of "interesting anecdotal

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

Is it just me, or has this part gotten beyond useful?

Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty
on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...

Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept.
His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him,
and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member
of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways
of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum.
The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West
we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control
and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think
the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say
"in agreement") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the
secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may
have chosen.

With that in mind, it not possible under secular law ("legally" as most
people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once
they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree
that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there
any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past
group member.

A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties
of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties
in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when
the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person
_in conflict with secular law_.

This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular
authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.
Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements
_may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or
may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).

Dew

Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and
re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.  Not only will flawless
cosmetic surgery be possible, but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY.

What will it be like to store all the prices of shelf-priced bar-coded
goods in your head, and catch all the errors they make in the store's
favor at SAFEWAY?  What will it be like to mentally edit and spell-
check your responses to the questions posed by a phone caller selling
VACATION TIME-SHARE OPTIONS?

Indeed, we are today a nation at risk!  The threat is not from bad genes,
but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes
which are the units of genetics.

We stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful
memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will
run rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that
future technology has to offer.

For example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions
against the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at
CALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid
Mary.

We must expand the public-health laws to include quarantine of people
with harmful memes.  They should not be allowed to infect other people
with their memes against genetically-engineered food, electromagnetic
fields, and the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's

on the wuarchive.

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
dtax.exe.

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing

The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you

I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have
the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.

If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then

I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant
by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the
law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable. 


>Hence, on such clarification from the ulama [Islamic scholars], Muslims
>in Britain before and after Imam Khomeini's fatwa made it very clear
>that since Islamic law is not applicable to Britain, the hadd
>[compulsory] punishment cannot be applied here."


I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the 
Islamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion 
does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion 
that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However, 
I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were*
it well founded.

>Wow... from the above, it looks like that from an Islamic viewpoint

Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal

Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film
system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.

If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:

For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to
produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local
network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the
image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the
video to the Net.

We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for
use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for
commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.

The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll
digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as
an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker
of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been
unable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields per
second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60
fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some
find distracting.

If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing 
software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of
different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.

Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever
used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology
and the user interface.

The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-
itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),
Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.

For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality
that will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more
effects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system
will look better.

We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!

The si has a single expansion slot, that can be either PDS or Nubus, but not
both together. The card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & HD and
requires an adaptor slot to do this. There are Nubus and PDS adaptort cards.
Thus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you
have. With the exception of the Radius rocket, all NuBus cards I know of work
in the si. PDS slots and thus cards are Mac specific, thus not all PDS cards
work in all Macs.

Leonard, I'll give you an example of this....

My father recently bought a business, the business price was 150,000 pounds
and my father approached the people in the community for help, he raised
60,000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and 
Muslims he knew, 50,000 had cash and the rest he got a business loan, after
paying off the Muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans
to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest, this
is an example of a Muslim community helping one another, why did they help
because of their common identity as Muslims. In turn my father has helped
with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay 
and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more
fortunate in the community. 

The fact is Leonard it DOES work without a fluffy bunny in sight!
iThat is the beauty of Islam.

Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum.  This would cause the filament
to ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressure
vessel, followed by an explosion when the neck assembly (mostly likely
cracked to begin with) blows off.  During the whole sequence of events,
the other circuits may continue functioning, which accounts for not
losing sound.

Good point...also, I wouldn't be surprised that the components
they use off-shore are of inferior quality.  As long as it was
properly designed and robust, premium components are used, it
shouldn't matter where it is assembled.

An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound.
The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.

Actually, I'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though
the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive 
heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component
regardless of quality.  In fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is
because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....

Hi there,


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers.

On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of
32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?
On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capable
of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that
both machines have 16-bit color capability.
Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?
From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
16-bit color, is that correct?

Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they
seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?


Thanks for your help!

Well, for example, the goal of "natural" morality is the survival and
propogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is
presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we
should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see,
to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is,
we shall be moral unto what end?

Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most
every moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system
and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  I think that
it is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.

Well, "objective" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
concepts, while "arbitary" implies no clear line of reasoning.

DEC did this on their new alpha chip.  I'm sure you could call them up
and ask them how they did it (haha).

Actually, there are some details in their article in IEEE Journal of
Solid-State Circuits.  I think it was sometime around Nov.  1992.

This may be a safety issue; the CSA is more paranoid in certain areas than
UL and such.  Two caps in series means that you don't have a short if one
of them shorts.

No need to be sorry, I blew it on this one.  At the main breaker box
where there is a thick wire ground leading to the earth, both neutral
and ground are hooked to this bus.  In any other breaker box (or an
outlet box, etc.) the ground and neutral must not be connected together.

I agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC
with a Quadra. I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called
8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression
from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though
in a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they
asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...

                      TUTORIAL PROGRAM
Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on 
Tuesday, July 6.

12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer 
 Scientists"  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)

This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.  
Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected 
other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology.

12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming 
languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge 
representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background, 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. 
Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry.

3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory) 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic 
views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain.

3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming" 
 Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)

The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly 
non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an 
extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will 
also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications, and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught 
this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in 
the field.

3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis" 
 Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) 
 & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, 
represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order 
syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area 
of word-based analyses.

Is there some difference between the purposes behind
amniocentesis and chorionic villi sampling? They sound
similar to me, but are intended to detect different
things?

Thanks.

An universe it has created. By the way, can you tell me why it is less
tyrannic to let one of one's own creatures do what it likes to others?
By your definitions, your god has created Satan with full knowledge what
would happen - including every choice of Satan.
 
Can you explain us what Free Will is, and how it goes along with omniscience?
Didn't your god know everything that would happen even before it created the
world? Why is it concerned about being a tyrant when noone would care if
everything was fine for them? That the whole idea comes from the possibility
to abuse power, something your god introduced according to your description?

The poster casually trashed two thousand years of Jewish history, and 
Ken replied that there had previously been people like him in Germany.

That's right.   There have been.    There have also been people who
were formally Nazis.   But the Nazi party would have gone nowhere
without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the
street who behaved as though casual anti-semitism was perfectly
acceptable.

You have given that example. It is not lenient. End of argument.
 
And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. It
rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system
without checking if they suit the description.

As usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sex
nor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher, the point is, a very important
point, the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is even
stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. The
consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids.
Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex
is not controlled is completely counterfactual.
 
 
And since you have brought up the point, is your god evil or not?

Summary: Headaches and analgesics
Lines: 95


I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,
(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had
forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.
I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've
found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources
that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some
pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much
worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past
(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due
to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced
the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately
after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the
only "real solution" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have
any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and
one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had
the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested
I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks
that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan
to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out
the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something
similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me
horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In
fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take
it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both 
legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until
I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes
several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective
at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime
I'm frequently in severe pain.

The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in
bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs
(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with
nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to
what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have
several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)
it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan
was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others
hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.
The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation
compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,
called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the
"internal nerves" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that
I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain
is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,
I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain
to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9
months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd 
always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,
and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical
therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month
or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,
but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at
a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going
away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which
could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have
nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off
traction about 2 weeks ago.

Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid
taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because
I have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (Oh, I forgot
to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,
but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,
occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at
a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading
and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,
I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because
the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can
cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric
shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad
I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home
and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the
migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot
of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.
I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so
I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take
more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will
eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when
I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan
becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications
(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but
they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?
My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the
pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of
pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped
once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the
succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.

Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute
to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.

If you mean "reactive" hypoglycemia, there are usually no symptoms,
hence there is no disease, hence the dietary recommendations are the
same as for anyone else.  If a patient complains of dizziness,
faintness, sweating, palpitations, etc. reliably several hours after
a big meal, the recommendations are obvious - eat smaller meals.

This past week I've been playing with some of the R-D (Reaction-
Diffusion, not to be confused with RDS or R&D) techniques
from SIGGRAPH '91.

I was wondering what material is available to explain the control
mechanism a little more.  It seems to me very much like a matter of
picking random magic numbers and sitting back and waiting.  Although
both of the papers (Turk and Witkin & Kass) were very well organized
and extremely helpful, I guess what I need is a more basic description
of the technique, especially wrt the control mechanisms.  The tests
that I did had a tendency to either turn into blurry mud or become
unstable.

Is there any info available online?  Source code would be great but
not necessary.

Thanks!

Subject: Need advice with doctor-patient relationship problem
Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA

I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican
which upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain.
He suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I
need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may
monitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.

I did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary).
I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request,
and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more
frequent and the medication did not seem effective.

The doctor called me back, and his first words were, "Whatever you want,
you'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit-
chat with you!"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to
call on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I 
then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he
had more time.  He responded, "Just spit it out now because no time is
a good time."  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and
tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my
nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered
and then said "well, never mind" and he said he'll talk to various
colleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.

This doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express
myself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I
was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering
how angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told
me that he just doesn't have time to "rap with patients" and thought
that was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to
"rap" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through
on his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he 
felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his
patients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me

mistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you
but I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of
time to deal with that."  He then told me to call him the next day
for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.

I am still upset and have not yet called.

My questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?
(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to
be more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?
If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type
of pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but
now I am afraid to call him.

  No. The christians were leary of having an atheist spokesman
  (seems so clandestine, and all that), so they had him removed.  Of
  course, Keith is busy explaining to his fellow captives how he
  isn't really being persecuted, since (after all) they *are*
  feeding him, and any resistance on his part would only be viewed
  as trouble making.  

  I understand he did make a bit of a fuss when they tatooed "In God
  We Trust" on his forehead, though.

Yes, but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize
Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think
the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their
beliefs.

And actually, I think that the government already does recognize that
Christianity is the dominant religion in this country.  I mean, it is.
Don't you realize/recognize this?

This isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of
Christianity, just that most people do.

No, but I hear quite a bit about Christmas, and little if anything about
Jesus.  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really
associated to a high degree with him?  Or are you saying that the
association with Jesus is on a personal level, and that everyone thinks
about it but just never talks about it?

That is, can *you* prove that most people *do* associate Christmas
most importantly with Jesus?

I think the numbers *do* matter.  It takes a majority, or at least a

You can include postscript epsi files in xfig (encapsulated postscript

to draw over the postscript file.

I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes.
Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great
science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre
science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have
been concerned with the difference between what is science and
what is not. 

Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between
Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of
their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a
genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts
are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or
Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your
own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre
physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and
the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the
cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.
Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to
do this.  

Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked
to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many
kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is
that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of
criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either
not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the
one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the
one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.

I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered 
scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,
not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect
that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;
what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the
presence of qi.

Certainly a "theoretical structure that makes sense" is the goal.
In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with
forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot
always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything
clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to
plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can.

Organization: University of Vermont -- Division of EMBA Computer Facility

Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than
sugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces 
when it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to
for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate 
substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde
produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to
living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  

Phenylalanine is
nothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses small
quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a disease
known as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to 
degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them, it will 
accumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve
cells.  Therefore, it is Only a major problem in young children (until around
age 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  It used to
be a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easily 
detected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine
as a child, or when pregnant.

Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it
did the same thing!  Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the
same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.

#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want
to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll 
*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any
case, don't kick it around! :-) 

#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned
out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess
the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it
being more than 50 cents!.

Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set of
schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around
the flyback.

This problem is most likely the same that all cx users are experiencing....
Thanks to one very adventurous USENET reader (sorry I can't remember the

us all $$$$$) it is easily fixed, if it is the same problem......


Best I can figure it is due to time, heat and repeated warmup/cool downs in
the power supply....i.e., bad solder joints in the power supply circuit
card.  Go get a desolder tool from radio shack, a low wattage iron and some
good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit
card with the AC plugs facing away from you..........or get someone to do
it for you.  It took me less then 10 minutes and saved me at least $300 for
a new supply!

I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner

Is anyone familiar with this drive?

At the end of the drive (oposite the 50 pin pibbon connector), there
are eleven pins which look like this:


        o o o o o   o   1
          o o o o   o   2

         L5  CR12   C37

where the "o" are pins, and the "L5 CR12 C37" represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins.

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E1,E2,E3,E4
on the silk screen.

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A0,A1,A2 pins are, and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into?

I am not aware of any "Turkish Caliphate" viewpoint on this. Can you
reference?

However, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:

"Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their
advice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow
them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's
wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.
  We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own
devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal
desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great
anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most
corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any
charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to
miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they
who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend
to refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.
Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.
And preserve us in any case from their good ones."

(Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, 
p. 118).

I wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM)
viewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophet's cousin and
the Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating 
night with a woman.

That's right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if
we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then
determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not
possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with
it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological
burdens, too.

Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,
they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually "believing"
in racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you
originated it.

 I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today. The cost is $299, but there
 are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone
 916/737-1550. He doesn't have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about

 that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes. 
 I'm going to check it out and see if it's got what I need for my CAD package.

 I also found another package: 3D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle.
 The number is: 206/868-5418, also no email. The package is strong at ray tracing,
 I'm not too sure about its geometry creation tools. I also need to look into this

There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both
atheists AND theists.  I'm sure Bobby can list quite a few for the atheist
side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at
genocide.  Perhaps, since I'm a bit weak on history, somone here would like

suspect I'm also the victim of a Dr. toliberal with the prescription 
p. The allergist I went to last Oct. simply inquired about my symptons 
( I was suffering chronic asthma attacks), gave me a battery of

more or much differently than before; I'vsuffered depression; , 
fatigue; and I've experienced a foul smell and sense of taste for 
about the last two months.  I mentioned the lack of smell and taste to 
this Dr. in Feb. and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen (he 
just looked up my nose with his little light--the same one used for 
ears), and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS (severe headaches 
and a rash resulted, particularly after my week's worth of Prednisone

 This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusions
 but in regards to *conventional* medicine.

 You see, I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know any
 different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist of
 teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates,
 and various health practitioners.
 If these people have gotten results with my method after having been
 unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldn't lose any 
 sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments --- 
 let's face it, with all the blunders committed by "scientific" MDs 
 over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific* 
 method in much lower esteem than they hold mine!

  Sorry, but I'm not familiar OR interested with what appears to be 
 'NEW AGE' medicine (ayurveda, crystals), with the exception of homeo-
 pathy, of which I took a course. But Gordon, you already knew that -
 you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out, right?
 
 I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to
 beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy
 does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.
 An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickly
 and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations.

 I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying the

 If you were to cook a meal, would you worry over whether EVERYONE

 Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken 
 entirely myself, I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide-

 I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person
 growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth,
 than for a civilized, well educated and scientifically trained mind
 to follow the doctrine of evolution.
 Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God
 how it is (properly) done. Now we've become capable of creating our
 own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right?

 But just before we get rid of Him for good, perhaps He could leave us

 poverty, racism, crime, riots, substance abuse... And one last thing, 
 could He also give us a hint on how to control natural disasters, the

I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all the
split groups, and it would make things easier for those of us
who are less omnivorous.  There is no "waste" in creating news
groups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.  I have no problem
with only a few posts per week per group - I spend too much time

I heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently
published results of a study on Multiple-Personality-Disorder Syndrome
patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may
have a psychological trigger or basis.  What I heard about this study was that
in one 'personality', a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs
of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what I heard),
while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including
testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants.

If this is true, it is truly fascinating.

But, I'd like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the study

Hi people..

OK heres my problem.... 
I keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which
detect IR light....

I believe that you have to 'charge them up' under normal (visible) light
and then if they are exposed to IR light they glow or something like
that...

I think that they are avaliable in the states and even in England, but
alas I live in Australia.  Could someone please inform me if I can get
these things over here, and if so where??? and how much???

Also are they really commonly avaliable in the states, and if so, then
how much are they and who sells them (maybe if I cant get one here, I'll
write to one of the companies over seas..)

Anyway.... Thanks in advance...

Yes some radar detectors are less detectable by radar detector
detectors. ;-)

Look in Car and Driver (last 6 months should do), they had a big

NEXT MEETING


The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights 
of Columbus Emerald Manor, 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale.  
Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman 
trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant 
Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University 
Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in 
transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is 
a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and 
always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a 
very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our 
hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence 
will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be 
cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome 
Dr. Teperman. 

          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE


LAST MEETING

It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of 
TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being 
able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  
No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored 
again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island 
Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many 
braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good 
conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, 
a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not 
able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to 
discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, 
an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient 
was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman 
gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, 
(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to 
minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine 
and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank 
her for an entertaining evening.



ANNUAL MEETING

In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is 
also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official 
notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main 
purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit 
member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and 
to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two 
year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following 
slate for the Board.

         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen
         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith
         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia
         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)
         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)
         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)
         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)

Those remaining on the Board for another year are:

         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)
         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn
         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy
         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)
         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)
         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)

This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work 
and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have 
backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition 
to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also 
be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board 
members and there is plenty of work. 

In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be 
given and the floor will be open for any new business, 
suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.

We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the 
majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.

FUTURE MEETINGS

Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  

     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry
                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center

     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony 
                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. 

Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.

NOTDAW

The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor 
Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, 
speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and 
Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   
because of two year's experience with miserable weather. 

We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We 
have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish 
a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to 
address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of 
life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample 
letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.

DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED 

The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will 
hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the 
Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas 
Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and 
are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne 
Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.

MEMBERSHIP NEWS 

Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant 
in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing 
well after only 12 days in hospital.

Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston 
Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation 
works!  We hope the national press notices. 
     
Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his 
transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis 
and feeling better.  

Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, 
spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems 
encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  
They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will 
continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. 

Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall 
that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a 
candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.
 
And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough 
winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.

SEE YOU......WEDNESDAY   APRIL 14  8 PM   K of C UNIONDALE

Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA

NNTP-Posting-Host: sipi.usc.edu

Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
would call Japan, etc.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Thanks.

Wow, what a concept!  Does anybody want to speculate on how this
"non-connection" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?
It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
stand upon in court.

Does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this?

I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having
 osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his
 illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. 

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 
 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal
 bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is
 attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the
 enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.
 This will eventually cause death.

Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and
 approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients
 administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable
 improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured
 by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000
 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called "the most
 expensive disease in the world".

NEED INFO:
I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying
 on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:
**news, stories, reports
**people you know with this disease
**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of
   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with
   costs.
**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER

Thanks so very much!

They are 3D object files for CAD 3D 2.0, a program written by Tom Hudson
for the Atari ST computers.  Don't know much more about them except that
they are stored with the points first, then the surfaces are next, and are
made by listing 3 point numbers that make up the triangle surface. Then
there's a header that describes coloring, lighting, etc.  Don't know much
more than this, hope this helps.

It so typically causes bone pain due to spinal metastases that it
gets manipulated frequently.  Manipulating a cancer riddled bone
is highly dangerous, since it can then fracture.  I've seen at
least three cases where this happened with resulting neurologic
damage, including paraplegia.  This is one instance where knowing
how to read x-rays can really help a chiropractor stay out of trouble.
DO chiropractors know what bony mets from prostate look like?

You have demanded harsh punishments of several crimes. Repeating
offenders have slipped in only as justification of harsh punishment at
all. Typically religious doublespeak. Whenever you have contradictory
statements you choose the possibility that suits your current argument.
 
It is disgusting that someone with ideas that would make Theodore KKKaldis

If you do a MEDLINE search on "turmeric" you'll see that it is a potent
lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas.
I'm in cardiology and about 4 years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my
hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs. a $2000
bolus of tPA in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused
Langendorff sheep heart. The turmeric was more effective :-)


A colleague of mine in the School of Pharmacy (Dr. Ron Kohen) has a paper "in
press" on the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity of tea.

My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I
bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably
enough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me to
get some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a
doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the
chemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say
either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil
is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His
father was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate
into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about
their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd
malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from
acne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.

My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort
of teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?  We have tried a
couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to
make the condition worse, not better.

Reply-To: paj@uk.co.gec-mrc (Paul Johnson)
Organization: GEC-Marconi Research Centre, Great Baddow, Essex
Lines: 45


I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I
came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling
components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a
current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side
to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I
think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.

Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for
picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an
efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour).

Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the
temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably
its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no
leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
(although that would be a lousy way to control it).

What I would like to know is:

1: Are the above guesses correct?

2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?
   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm
   too fast when I unplug it)

3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like
   magic!

4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?

	Well here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it.  

	In my five years of education in this field, though brief 
compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant.  
 
	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.

	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before her/his
sophamore year.                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.

	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you
are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. 
If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  
Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.

This is vague, so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more.

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
pickup.  The result was noisy and distinctly lo-fi, but much louder
than a conventional phonograph.  It tended to wear the disks out
pretty quickly though.

I shot off a response to this last night that I've tried to cancel.  It was 
only a few minutes later while driving home that I remembered that your

the PC12 pheochromocytoma line.  That may still be a good compromise, depending

Dear Mac-friends,

I've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines
all with 17 Mb RAM installed (70 or 80 ns SIMMs).

If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated
a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated
on the screen.  The lines translate to the top of the screen and
have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they
are a few millimeters apart).
I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly,
especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark.
Applications which produce this effect are:
- the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2)
- Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU

The machines use their built-in video and drive the old 
Apple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).  
The effect is independent of the settings in the following control 
panels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache) 
        and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).

Have you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?

Thanks,

Hello to everybody,
I write here because I am kind of desperate. For about six weeks, I've been
suffering on pains in my left head side, the left leg and sometimes the left 
arm. I made many tests (e.g. computer tomography, negative, lyme borreliosis,
negative, all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range), they're
all o.K., so I should be healthy. As a matter of fact, I am not feeling so.
I was also at a Neurologist's too, he considered me healthy too.

The blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin (17.5,
common range is 14 to 17, I unfortunately do not know about the units).
Could these hemi-sided pains be the result of this or of a also possible
block of the neck muscles ?

I have no fever, and I am not feeling entirely sick, but neither entirely 
healthy. 

Please answer by direct email on <ghilardi@urz.unibas.ch>

In order to excitotoxin effects of MSG, MSG that in blood must go through 
blood-brain barrier that I am not sure MSG can go through or not. In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 
2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA
receptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons. 

Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement, it is alsoinvolved in develpoment, memory and learn (it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning).

I need some help.  We are upgrading our animation/video editing stand. We
are looking into the different type of setups for A/B roll and a cuts only
station.  We would like this to be controlled by a computer ( brand doesnt matter but maybe MAC, or AMIGA).  Low end to high end system setups would be very
helpful. If you have a system or use a system that might be of use, could you
mail me your system requirements, what it is used for, and all the hardware and
software that will be necessary to set the system up.  If you need more 
info, you  can mail me at   eylerken@u.washington.edu

thanks in advance.

An unconventional remedy that you might try for altitude sickness in the Andes is
chewing coca leaves or taking teas made from coca leaves. You might notice that
many of the natives have wads in their mouths... the tea can be obtained in S.
American pharmacies. This remedy alleviates some of the lightheadedness and
dizziness - but don't try to jog with it. I've tried this when travelling and
hiking in Peru and Ecuador. The amount of cocaine you would ingest are too minute
to cause any highs...

Also it is a good idea to eat lightly and dress warm while adjusting to high altitudes.

Yes but a key issue is _SPEED_ how fast is Imagine? And is it as easy to
use
as 3D Studio? Can it just do a render as fast as 3DS if you don't want
things like IOR etc.. 3DS can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps,
animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the IPAS routines 
(Not that I've ever seen them) It can do explosions, top quality
morphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc..
I'm not knocking imagine, I just want to know how it compares with 3DS

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I
is running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long

   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for
making cool awesome games (read psygnosis).

I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.

Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the
accompanying documentation:


                              DMPEG V1.0

                       Public Domain MPEG decoder

                           by Stefan Eckart


0. Features
===========

DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:


 - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard
   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)

 - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display

 - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)

 - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale

 - color-space selection

 - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required

 - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)

 - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
   VGA and many Super-VGAs

...

4. Technical information
========================

The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].
The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]
(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero
coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT
(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'
algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main
difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to
use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).

Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to
+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed
over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points
is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.

Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve
on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas.

Hi again,

Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS-

So, in summary:

There are two choices:

1)	Various screen grabber packages (Corel Draw has one, there are

2)	Use the built-in PrintScreen and Alt-PrintScreen functionality
to paste the screen (or window) to the clipboard.  Then paste the

And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential
diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign
intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other
headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist
can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the
diagnosis.

Sigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even
after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic
examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,
salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask "why can't you
order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?"  Aunt Millie often gets
into the conversation, as in "they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches
for years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or
whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a
patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear
what your magic is.

Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.
Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,
but the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if the
hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were
"nothing"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper
than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.

	This is not  strickly correct. Only by incorrect application of the 
rules of language, does it seem to work.

	The Mercedes in the first premis, and the one in the second are NOT 
the same Mercedes. 

	In your case, 

	A = B
	C = D
	
	A and D are NOT equal. One is a name of a person, the other the
name of a object. You can not simply extract a word without taking the 
context into account. 

	Of course, your case doesn't imply that A = D.

	In his case, A does equal D.


	Try again...

It seems to work equally well for CFS, another hint that these may be

Yes.  The benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it.
Most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose
amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule
(current standard therapy).  Because of the cost (usually > $150/mo.,
depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like
corneal injury and birth defects, I currently reserve it for those who
fail conventional treatment.  It is important that the person
prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient

I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
"storys" about them. OK ?
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
         It has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the "CARNOT-process" which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and "cold"
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
         energy that carnot will give them.
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,
         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment !
         
   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-
         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere

Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This
is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the
stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI 
accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,
New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.

I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive
tower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto
which I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally
terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems
occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two
internal hard drives.

It works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.

I would like to know what people's opinions are about the 
"real world" differences are between a C650 with and without 
a coprocessor...

I don't use anything like Mathamatica, Maple, etc. I don't use
Spreadsheets (at least no sheets with complicated anything), I
don't use 3D CAD apps (although I used to), 

I DO:  use 3D renderers, EXTENSIVE communications, I run a BBS,
I write software, I write papers, etc...

BTW, just for kicks, this is what I was told by my local Apple
Rep about upgrading a 68LC040 to a 69RC040 on a C650:
"Well, Apple built in an extra socket for the coprocessor chip.
 That way, you just plug in the coprocessor, and it works."
I then heartily laughed and hung up the phone.

thanks,

Lines: 48


  Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the
process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 
and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent
Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through 
June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with 
ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge 
tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.
 
X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:
 
1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types
   available through a large collection of X resources.
2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.
3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.
4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.
5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget 
   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar 
   to X programmers.
6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.
   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical
   layout of an application.
 
C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:
 
1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library
   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C
   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.
2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse 
   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control
   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.
3. Large collection of high-level application functions for "two-call"
   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available
   with minimal programming effort.
4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling
   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot
   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can 
   control the event loop.
 
If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please
contact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call
713-279-1066.

I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.  I had to get
rid of my "venerable" Bernoulli 20 last year (with enough 
cartridges purchased at ~$90 each to make the whole thing 
worth more than my whole computer ;).  The tech support guys

format/mount/partition for A/UX.

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip
micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only
costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed
the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,
use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely
on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want
to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut
you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.

If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of 
maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET
to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than 
you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add
a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count
screams up to 9.

PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This
application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the 
programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM:

I put 2 256K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever.  I have been told that
the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel still
lists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.

Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?
Do you have to do something to activate them?
Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?

BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.

I've had very good results from the SSM2016 from PMI (part of Analogue

1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope
and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual
certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset
control's zero detent position.

2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many
generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest
flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm
terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector
on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out
.4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may
also find that loading the output of the function generator also
reduces the harmonic distortion.

Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to
use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the
voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:

------10K--------+---------? ohm ----
                 |
Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.
(loaded)         |
-----------------+-------------------

Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy
to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can
virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the
millivolt test generator you want.

Good luck,

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 ("ruggedized") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got "funny" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

No, you don't understand.  I said that I don't think people can discuss

People here have said that everyone would be better off without religion,

But, guns and axes are tools, both of which have been used for murder.
Should both be taken away?  That is to say, I don't think motto misuse
warrants its removal.  At least not in this case.

Acorn Replay running on a 25MHz ARM 3 processor (the ARM 3 is about 20% slower
than the ARM 6) does this in software (off a standard CD-ROM). 16 bit colour at
about the same resolution (so what if the computer only has 8 bit colour
support, real-time dithering too...). The 3D0/O is supposed to have a couple of
DSPs - the ARM being used for housekeeping.

A 25MHz ARM 6xx should clock around 20 ARM MIPS, say 18 flat out. Depends
really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARM6x or ARM6xx
(the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with
slower memory).

I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after
graduation...

Mike

PS Don't pay heed to what reps from Philips say; if the 3D0/O doesn't beat the
   pants off 3DI then I'll eat this postscript.

What conclusion can be drawn from this?  I'm trying to figure out what kind

ideas?

Um, I hate to break this to you, but article numbers are unique per site.

You mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests
which show no such "chinese restaurant effect" unique to MSG
(it's elicited by the placebo as well.)

Like youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?

No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid
which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that
excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain
conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few.
This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid
in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.

>and that its major constituent, glutamate
>is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
>(humans included).

I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.

>Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.

Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any
controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far
as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is
not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently
ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe
that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.

Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink?
Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much
glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that
added by the use of MSG?

Notice the subtle covering of her ass here: "anyone _with a sensitivity_..."
We're disputing the size of that class.

Impeccable.  There most certainly is a dispute.

Yes, there is such a thing as eye dominance, although I am not sure if
this dominance refers to perscription strength.

As i recall, if you selectively close your dominant eye, you will percieve
that the image shifts. This will not happen if you close your other eye.

I believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness, but I
can't recall the relation at the moment.

We were talking about Migraine and Exercise (I'm the one who can't
fathom the thought of exercise during migraine...).  Anyway, turning
the thread around, the other day I played tennis during my lunch
hour.  I'm out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise.  I
got overheated, and dehydrated.  Afterwards, I noticed a tingling
sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later, I could feel
a migraine start.  (I continued to drink water in the afternoon.)
I took cafergot, but it didn't help and the pain started although
it wasn't as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the
pain subsided.

This isn't the first time that I've had a migraine occur after exercise.
I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder
what triggers the migraine in this situation (heat buildup? dehydration?).
I'm not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do (besides get into 
shape and don't play at high noon) to prevent this?

Thanks,

"Contradictory" is a property of language.  If I correct this to

I will object to definitions as reality.  If you then amend it to

     Are we talking about ColorView for DOS here?  
     I have version 2.0 and it writes the temp files to its own

     What later versions do, I admit that I don't know.
     Assuming your "expert" referenced above is talking about

I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried
is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without
really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted
in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is
available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000
GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What?

Have there been any important and documented investigations into
homeopathic principles?

I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the
section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two
paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide
any sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride, as though
it were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is
it because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathy
really looks more like witch-doctory than anything else?

The magnets are huge!  Good MRI sets with big (>1.5 Tesla) magnets

Why would it have to be much faster (it probably is) ? Assuming an ARM
is about as efficient as a MIPS R3000 for integer calculations, doing
a Compact-Video-like digital video codec is an easy task. For Software
Motion Pictures (which is a lot like Compact Video, though it predates
it), we get 48 frames/sec. at 320x240 on a DECstation 5000/200. That
machine has a 25 Mhz MIPS R3000.

Compartment syndrome occurs when swelling happens in a "compartment"
bounded by fascia.  The pressure rises in the compartment and blood
supply and nerves are compromised.  The treatment is to open the
compartment surgically.  THe most common places for compartment
syndromes are the forearm and calf.  It is an emergency, since
if the pressure is not relieved, stuff will die.

Well, it's obvious that you *don't* attempt, otherwise you would be aware
that they *don't* all "loudly [claim] to be the One True Christian".

I've tried to avoid using the phrase "is/is not christian" because of these
ownership issues; instead, I've tried the phrase "Nicene christianity" in an
attempt to identify the vast majority of "christianity" which has roughly
similar viewpoints on the core theological issues.  The JWs do not fall
within this group and in fact espouse a position known as Arianism, which is
rejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well.

I'll take a wild guess and say Freedom is objectively valuable.  I base
this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly
of their freedom (so that their every act was contrary to their volition),
almost all would want to complain.  Therefore I take it that to assert or
believe that "Freedom is not very valuable", when almost everyone can see
that it is, is every bit as absurd as to assert "it is not raining" on
a rainy day.  I take this to be a candidate for an objective value, and it
it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values
such as this exist.

I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout
back in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the
same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has
been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for.

On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this
camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing
it. Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo.

I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the
tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!)
included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert
bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be
imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap.
Result - the file is completely in Corel format and
can be SCODAL'ed no problem!

BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the
solution less than idea, is that the trace utility
spits out many more points than are necessary to
define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and
curves are both traced as many short segments.

So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to
image.

The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping
out the extra points by hand using Corel.

OUCH!
I've done it a few times :-]

As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route...
BITMAP -> COREL (VIA TRACE) ->
HAND TRIMMING (USING COREL)!!! ->
COMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC (VIA IMPORT) -> SCODAL

This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something.
As a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous
is going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case.
When I do get really sick, it is always something unusual.

This was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on
pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on the
pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious
challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid
months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!

I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly
exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later
on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us,
so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that
the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, don't forget that the
hospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that
around.

Tail-recursive functions in Scheme are at least as efficient as iterative

I'm sure zero-intested economical systems survive on a small-scale,
co-ops is not an Islamic invention, and we have co-operatives working

Dear Netters
I want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. 
Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each
running person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred 
meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is
about 150MHz and about 440MHz.
To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best 
the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather 
specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-
units i need.
On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I 
need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete  
receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers 
as needed in the particular case.
DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER 
SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?

   Yeah, the "Feingold Diet" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD
   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents
   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their

Thanks for all the interest in this problem of mine. I don't think it
is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown
any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.
She has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.

The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made
by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to
something in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our
immediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running
nose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history
including some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms. 

Anyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body
chemistry.  But so far, no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures
either.  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh of
relief.  Thanks again.

Well corrupted the first time is good enough.  Seeing that the bible was constructed

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.
If only those christian "scientists" would take note.

(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian 
scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly
true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified
by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are 
trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the
error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed 
light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been 
accounted for. :-] )

>	The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a

Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never 
intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one
up?

Millions of people have "died for a lie".  This  point is difficult to 
substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments
work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed 
themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory
of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.

>Call me a fool, but I believe he did heal people.
  
That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)
to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to
the claim that Jesus was the "real thing".


>	Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
>to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example

Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the
point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his
many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based 
(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with 
his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler
was sane....

Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a "Therefore..."

This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with
people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think
people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of
metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to
present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or
she will end up in all sorts of shit.   

Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe
the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, 
who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the
book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say "a is
equal to b because a is equal to b".

  

>	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  

That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed 
in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all

I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames
than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments
of a stranger should be of interest to other people. 

Someone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one
rules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I
could probably find the exact quotation.

The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason
to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep 
in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.
This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless
you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the
LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most
people and has a great price.

If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.
16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again.

Subject: Water supplies vulnerable to Milwaukee-type disease outbreak
Organization: R-node Public Access Unix - 1 416 249 5366
Lines: 182

Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council.

 New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To
Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak
 To: National Desk, Environment Writer
 Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both
          of the Natural Resources Defense Council

   WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data released
today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about
100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San
Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms
leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease
outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee.
   The EPA list is attached.
   "These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water
supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate
pollution controls or filtration," said Erik Olson, a senior
attorney with NRDC.  "Water contamination isn't just a problem in
Bangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston."
   "As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on
EPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe
Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either
filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use
from pollution," Olson continued.  Some systems are moving
towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are
expected to miss the law's deadline.
   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already
a reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface
water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent
of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism
cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite
called giardia.
   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office
study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee
Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the
nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary
surveys of water systems.
   "This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions
of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be
assured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately
put into place programs to protect water sources from
contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment
must be installed to protect the public," Olson noted.  "The time
has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop
dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from
contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs
needed to assure their water is safe to drink."

  Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or
TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable.  This is pretty much a standard for DOS, Windows and OS/2
applications.

It's plain yoghurt with grated cucumber and coriander (other spices are
sometimes used). Some people use half yoghurt and half mayonaise.

The P&G pots are very good.  The Alps ones are usually carried by
the same folks who run the Audio Amateur magazine.  

I'll also recommend the Noble potentiometers, if you don't mind weird

The "`little' things" above were in reference to Germany, clearly.  People
said that there were similar things in Germany, but no one could name any.
They said that these were things that everyone should know, and that they
weren't going to waste their time repeating them.  Sounds to me like no one
knew, either.  I looked in some books, but to no avail.

It has *caused* problems?  Again, no one has shown that things were better
before the motto, or that they'd likely be better after.  I don't think
the motto initiates any sort of harassment.  Harassment will occur whether
or not the motto is present.

It probably wouldn't help for you to post the number, since it appears
to be different in each area.  For what it's worth, in the New Orleans
area the number is 998-877-6655 (easy to remember, what?)

I attended high school in the San Jose, California area in the early 1980's,
and I remember a (smallish) outbreak of a strange illness, in which
people developed measles-like spots on their bodies.  This condition
seemed to last only a few days, and I don't recall anyone reporting any other
symptoms.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have
been viral in nature, but I don't know for sure.

However, I have been curious since then about this.

Anyone have any ideas about what this might have been?

Is the Pope Catholic?

There MUST be SOME connection between those two lines!

Computer Graphics Resource Listing : WEEKLY POSTING [ PART 2/3 ]
===================================================
Last Change : 17 April 1993


14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)

  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner
  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).
  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.

Robot
-----
  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written
  in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).
  Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at
  ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28),  pub/astrod.

VG plotting library
-------------------
  This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov
  [129.6.64.151]

Xgobi
-----
  It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are
  multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it
  from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena
  widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge
  from STATLIB at CMU.
  To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and
  in the body area of the message, put the line

  send xgobi from general

  If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu. Log in as
  "statlib" and use your e-mail address as your password. Then type

  cd general
  mget xgobi.*

  Warning: It's about 2 MB sources + large Postscript manual. Read the
  relevant README to decide whether you need it or not.

PGPLOT
------
  Runs on VAX/VMS and supposedly on UNIX. It's a set of fortran routines freely
  available (though copyrighted and requiring a nominal fee of $50 or so)
  that includes contour plots and support for various devices, including ps.
  Contact tjp@deimos.caltech.edu

GGRAPH
------
  Host shorty.cs.wisc.edu [128.105.2.8] : /pub/ggraph.tar.Z
  Unknown more details.

epiGRAPH
--------
  For PCs. Call dvj@lab2.phys.lgu.spb.su (Vladimir J. Dmitriev) for details.
  You can get the program demo or (and) play version, if sent 10 $ to

+Athena Plotter Widget set
+-------------------------
+  
+  This version V6.0 is based on Gregory Bond's version V5-beta. Added
+  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,
+  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.
+  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the
+  plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a
+  log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other
+  changes/extensions, besides 
+  
+      -     Origin and frame lines for axes.
+      -     Subgrid lines on subtic positions.
+      -     Line plots in different line types (lines, points, lines+points,
+       impulses, lines+impulses, steps, bars), line styles (solid, dotted,
+       dashed, dot-dashed) and marker types for data points.
+      -     Legend at the right or left hand side of the plot.
+      -     Optional drawing to a pixmap instead of a window.
+      -     Layout callback for aligning axis positions when using
+       multiple plotters in one application.
+  
+  Available at export.lcs.mit.edu, directory contrib/plotter
+
+SciPlot
+-------
+  SciPlot is a scientific 2D plotting and manipulation program.

+PLPLOT
+------
+  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)
+  and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness,
+  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:
+  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,
+  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or
+  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
+  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually
+  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are
+  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four
+  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and
+  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.
+  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),
+  including a portable metafile format and renderer.
+  
+  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on
+  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot
+  
+  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:
+  
+  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix
+  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.


Macintosh-based tools
=====================

NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more
---------------------------------
  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,
  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been
  developed by Spyglass.

NIH IMAGE
---------
  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)
  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.  Video-rate
  capture, display, processing, and analysis of high-resolution
  monochromatic and color images.  Includes C source code."

TCL-Image:
  "Software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and
  analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,
  and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.
  TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the
  other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm
  development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily
  extensible through "script" (or indirect command) files. These script
  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are
  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.
  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame
  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides
  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF."

  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200

Satellite Image Workshop
------------------------
  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all
  sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-
  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't
  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1

  "An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image
  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting."

  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

  94039-7900 415-961-4400

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

Dapple Systems
--------------
  "High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to
  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of
  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data."

  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

Dimple
------
  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or
  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has
  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image
  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose."

  "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its
  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of
  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt
  language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining
  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down
  menus etc... It is unprotected software."

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

  Eidetic Digital Image Ltd. in British Columbia.  Its for IBM PC's or
  clones, cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff Erdas does but is not
  as fast or as powerful, though I have had only limited experience with
  Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good
  starter program except for the obtuse manual"

IMAGINE-32
----------
  It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called "Imagine32"
  or "Image32" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,
  subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.
  It can also display a number of images simultaneously.
  The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA. 

PC Vista
--------
  It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.  It is known to
  be available from Mike Richmond, whose email addresses have been

	richmond@bllac.berkeley.edu
	richmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu

  and his s-mail address is:

  Michael Richmond,Astronomy Department, Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720

  The latest version of PC-Vista, version 1.7, includes not only the source
  code and help files, but also a complete set of executable programs and
  a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code,
  you will need Microsoft C, version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work,
  but will require substantial modifications.

  Systems and Software. They are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 I
  heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber
  software. 

MIRAGE
------
  It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the
  Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.
  It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image
  processing displaying functions built in. 

DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK

ALV
---
  A Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to
  comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to
  alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.

AIPS
----
  Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,
  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,
  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)
  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building
  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.
     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy
  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a
  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few.

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels

Global Imaging Software
-----------------------
  "We use Global Imaging Software to process AVHRR data, from the dish to
  the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to
  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
  and carefree.

  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.

  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for
  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000
  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA
----
[ Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal. These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in
  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.
o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for
   registration.
o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or
   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers
   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,
   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and
   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights
   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass
   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)
   to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system.
o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to
   HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.)
o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy
output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me.
Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and
lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)
image to black and white dots.

So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:
	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM
	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print
	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript
	lpr			# print

pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:
If you want your image to be 4" wide, use:
	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
	is high)
-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)
-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
	width less than 4", and will thus be printed smaller than 4" wide.
	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4", and
	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
	paper width. 
	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
	but it will not blow it up automatically.

Hope this helps.

Some VESA bios's support this mode (0x100).  And *any* VGA should be able to
support this (640x480 by 256 colors) since it only requires 256,000 bytes.
My 8514/a VESA TSR supports this; it's the only VESA mode by card can support
due to 8514/a restrictions. (A WD/Paradise)

A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs
or true RAM, yet if I set my extensions to use a large amount of memory
(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder
comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or
sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's
memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and
so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the
others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods
mentioned above).

Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got
this information:

%%% Memory info %%%

Physical RAM size: 20480K.
Logical RAM size: 20480K.
Size of Low Memory Area: 8K.

32 bit System zone: Absent.
Parity RAM: Not capable.
Growable System Heap: True.
Temporary memory support: Present.

Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem?
How can I turn this on?  Any ideas?

Can anyone help?

The problem is that My Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will not

the SCSI port on the PowerBook.

I then got a cable assembled to adapt the original cable to fit the SCSI
port. This, however, turned the computer into SCSI mode and treated it
as a hard disk.

I have asked an engineer in London to assembled a new cable. The idiot,
out of sheer laziness has taken 14 weeks and has yet to solve the
problem. 

I am aware that Caere Co. in the US have a solution.

Do you know of a cable that will solve this problem. Please help me if
you know the solution. I will be forever grateful to you.

I hope this is the correct newsgroup for this.

What is the scoop on Methanol and its future as an alternative fuel for
vehicles ?  How does it compare to ethanol ?

There was some news about health risks involved.  Anybody know about
that.  How does the US Clean Air act impact the use of Methanol by the
year 1995 ?

I think its Methyl Tertiary butyl ether which the future industries will
use as a substitute for conventional fuels.

There is company Methanex which produces 12% of the world's supply of
Methanol. Does anybody know about it ?

Please reply by e-mail as I do not read these newsgroups.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers

	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not
	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If
	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't
	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,
	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;
	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.

	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National
	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).
	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail
	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections
	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,
	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!

	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the
	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,
	however, do not.  Check your with your local building
	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in
	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,
	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements
	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that
	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family
	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial
	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different
	rules.

	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in
	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.
	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line
	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number
	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've
	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or
	``CEC''.

	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often
	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.

Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the
	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.
	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.
	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly
	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the
	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged
	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.
	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized
	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the
	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for
	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --
	US$65 plus shipping and handling.

Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up
	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance
	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.
	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two
	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,
	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.
	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified
	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA
	standard itself.  In this FAQ, "CEC" really means the
	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is
	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th
	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th
	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an
	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.

	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical
	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In
	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't
	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I
	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the
	equivalent NEC publications.

	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout
	the province.

Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?

	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.
	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical
	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's
	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do
	wiring in "commercial" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)
	are usually considered "semi-commercial" or "commercial".  However,
	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial
	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can
	find one willing to supervise.

	If you do your own wiring, an important point:

	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better
	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,
	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make
	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills
	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.
	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that
	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,
	and will impress the inspector.

	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to
	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your
	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.
	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely
	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.

	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.

	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip
	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector
	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it
	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of
	12ga wire through your hand that way.

	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C
	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types
	become very brittle.

Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?

	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few
	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're 
	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved
	devices) you need Robertson ("square recess") screwdrivers
	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.

	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4" or 1" spade bit and 1/4" or
	3/8" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or
	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2" drill
	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and
	3/4" or 1" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull
	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even
	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.

	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you
	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws
	work well).
	
	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or
	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart "combo stripper,
	crimper and bottle opener" types.  You should expect to pay
	$15 to $20 for a good "plier-type" pair.  It will have sized
	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should
	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the
	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There
	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't
	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.

	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends
	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.

	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.

	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling
	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire
	loops with a "loop former hole" on your wire stripper - more
	accurate.

	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for
	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the
	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,
	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a
	"zipper", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip
	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to
	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley
	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)
	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility
	that you'll gouge the conductors.

	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well
	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).
	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire
	or the insulation.

	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired
	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more
	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple
	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated
	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost
	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.

	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are
	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)
	and work well.  If you get more serious, a "audible alarm" type is
	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known
	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)

	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.
	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or
	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.

	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent
	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for
	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap 
	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination
	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to
	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet
	that has no cover plate).

Subject: What is UL listing?

	The UL stands for "Underwriters Laboratory".  It used to be
	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent
	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment
	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means
	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements
	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily
	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just
	that it probably won't kill you.

	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are
	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,
	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will
	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to
	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in
	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component
	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.
	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring
	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or
	occupancy permits issued.
	
Subject: What is CSA approval?

	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the
	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in
	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done
	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to
	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is
	required by law.

	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved
	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the
	claim.

	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC
	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to
	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance
	companies.

Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?

	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers

	    Residential Wiring
	    by Jeff Markell,
	    Craftsman Books,
	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.

	    Practical Electrical Wiring
	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National
	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70
	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan
	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.

	    Wiring Simplified
	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan
	    Park Publishing Co.
	
	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC
	revision.  Which is currently 1990.

	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called
	"Electrical Code Simplified".  There appears to be a version
	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the
	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,
	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get
	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer
	questions on the net ;-).

	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is
	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.

Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?

	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and
	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more
	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not
	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections
	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors
	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose
	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.

	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your
	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a
	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about
	this.

	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at
	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage
	claims.

	In general, the process goes like this:
		- you apply to your local inspections office or building
		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or
		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is
		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not
		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose
		  special conditions on you, require loading
		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point
		  they will tell you which inspections you will need.
		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to
		  have the panel and service connections inspected
		  before your power utility will provide a connection.
		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority
		  rather than the usual inspectors.
		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before
		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a
		  "rough-in" inspection.
		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,
		  you will need a "final inspection".

Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.
	Do I have to upgrade?

	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,
	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some
	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the
	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you
	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all
	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.

Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240

	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the
	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of
	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V
	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same
	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required
	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.
	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there
	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not
	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped
	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially
	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number
	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,
	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.
	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them "110V" and
	"220V", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will
	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.

	One thing that might make this a little more understandable
	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V
	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device
	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that
	low.

	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between
	phases of a 3-phase "Y" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any
	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase "Y"
	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.

	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended
	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...

Subject: What does an electrical service look like?

	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the
	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility
	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.

 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded
 	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes
 	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where
	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic
	action conductivity "breaks" (often between copper and iron pipe)).
	This is the "grounding conductor".  It is there to make sure that
	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire
	normally carries no current.

	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or
	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.
	It is connected to the "centre tap" (CEC; "center tap" in the
	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It
	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often
	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected
	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.

	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in
	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.
	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral
	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional
	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house
	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.

	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually
	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are
	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one
	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations 
	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do
	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your
	inspector.

	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the "hot"
	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as
	well.

	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each
	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,
	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the
	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.

	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.
	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected
	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one
	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some
	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only
	service).

Subject: What is a circuit?

	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.
	These connections are then used to supply power to selected
	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:
		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.
		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.
		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,
		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.

	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and
	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying
	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they
	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several
	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is
	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or
	air conditioners.

	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar
	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there
	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral
	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing
	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead
	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.
	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles
	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but
	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,
	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to
	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is
	permissible.]

	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,
	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.

	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a
	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.

	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground
	wire.  Since the white is "hot" in this case, both the NEC and CEC
	requires that the white wire be "permanently marked" at the ends
	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail
	polish or sometimes electrical tape.

	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the
	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.

	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)
	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places
	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is "frame ground",
	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an
	alternative to GFCI protection.

Subject: "grounding" versus "grounded" versus "neutral".

	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the
	"grounding" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green
	or bare wire.  The word "neutral" is reserved for the white when
	you have a circuit with more than one "hot" wire.  Since the white
	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the
	panel, the proper term is "grounded conductor".  However, the
	potential confusion between "grounded conductor" and "grounding
	conductor" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should
	never use the bare wire as a "grounded conductor" or white wire
	as the "grounding conductor", even though they are connected
	together in the panel.

	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground
	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]

	In the trade, and in common usage, the word "neutral" is used
	for "grounded conductor".  This FAQ uses "neutral" simply to
	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use "neutral"
	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light
	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.

Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?

	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power
	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For
	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should
	"trip", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As
	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the
	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the
	equipment itself won't cause a fire.

	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt
	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby
	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively
	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have
	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use
	a "time-delay" fuse (one brand is "fusetron") which will avoid
	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a
	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be
	replaced.

	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They
	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched
	into position against another contact.  When the current flow
	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip
	heats up and bends.  By bending it "trips" the latch, and the
	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave
	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to
	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high
	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite
	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown
	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which
	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in
	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the
	purpose.

	Neither fuses nor breakers "limit" the current per se.  A dead
	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even
	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which
	can often cause severe damage.

Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?

	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher
	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually
	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts
	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse
	being installed, or the proverbial "replace the fuse with a
	penny" trick.

	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better
	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.

	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When
	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting
	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,
	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical
	distribution transformer and having your house burn down.
	Breakers don't do this.

	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit
	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new
	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special
	inserts to "key" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)

	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse
	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse
	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the
	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently
	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you
	if you need one.

Subject: What size wire should I use?

	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,
	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,
	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid
	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than
	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.

	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for
	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or
	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate
	heat easily:

		Gauge		Amps
		14		15
		12		20
		10		30
		8		40
		6		65
	
	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent
	on the application and precise wire type.

Subject: Where do these numbers come from?

	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.
	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When
	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is
	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need
	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in
	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long
	runs.

	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.
	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller
	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most
	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits
	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger
	wire.

Subject: What does "14-2" mean?

	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors
	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second
	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but
	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  "14-2" means
	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.

	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes
	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In
	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.

	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.
	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.

Subject: What is a "wirenut"/"marrette"/"marr connector"?  How are they
	used?

	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used
	to connect wires together.  "Marrette" or "Marr connector"
	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.

	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them
	together, then twist the wirenut on.

	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the
	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically
	secure.

	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check
	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the
	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.

	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or
	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose ("linesman") pliers,
	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes
	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it
	goes in the wirenut properly.

	Some people wrap the "open" end of the wirenut with electrical
	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may
	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because
	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead
	of taping it, the connection should be redone.

Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?

	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures
	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the
	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the
	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other
	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of
	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any
	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking
	the circuit.

	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,
	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral
	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI
	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot
	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the
	GFCI happy.

	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.
	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed
	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be
	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices
	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be
	covered by a single GFCI outlet.

Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?

	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase
	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,
	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or
	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water
	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,
	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',
	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and
	laundry appliances.

	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there
	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or
	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you
	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to
	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.

	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may
	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI
	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI
	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in
	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your
	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?
	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does
	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?

Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?

	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a
	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run
	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,
	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs
	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that
	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary
	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most
	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no
	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring
	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.

Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?

	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the
	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with
	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI
	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE
	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one
	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch
	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),
	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a
	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;
	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on
	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such
	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.

	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use
	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use
	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.

	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one
	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't
	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first
	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet
	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But
	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.

	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little
	"ground fault protected" stickers that come with it and mark
	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which
	outlets are "downstream", simply by tripping the GFCI with the
	test button and see which outlets are dead.

Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?

	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,
	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without
	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against
	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of
	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an
	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the
	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly
	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not
	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if
	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of
	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very
	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace
	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).

	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In
	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with
	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating
	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will
	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;
	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were
	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to
	ground...

Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization

	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the
	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)
	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.
	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the
	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to
	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).

	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.

	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right
	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the
	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the
	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.
	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which
	prong the terminating screw connects to.

Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?

	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance
	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex
	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more
	than 24" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider
	than 12" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.
	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except
	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits
	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,
	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be
	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).

	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab
	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to
	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.
	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When
	"carrying through" to another outlet, the neutral must be
	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral
	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect
	from downstream outlets.

Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?

	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to
	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in
	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.

Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?

	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.
	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.
	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside
	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject
	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are
	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several
	different categories of NM cable.

	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or "AC" has a
	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is
	fairly resistant to damage.

	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic
	sheath.
	
	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable
	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer
	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25" (CEC & NEC)
	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected
	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of
	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.

	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored
	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,
	but this is technically illegal.]

	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the
	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague
	references to "exposed to mechanical damage" in both the NEC
	and CEC):

	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage
	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls
	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.
	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.
	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces
	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian
	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet
	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable
	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to "jump" to the appliance.
	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.
	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating
	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by
	      means of a 25mm/1" air space, or suitable insulation
	      material (a wad of fiberglass).
	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box
	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.
	      Holes in joists or studs are considered "supports".
	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to
	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,
	      it is permitted where "proper" support is impractical]
	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.
	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring
	      to the "workmanship" clause, but this seems more honoured
	      in the breach...]
	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or
	      similar finish.
	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.
	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists
	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more
	      than 1m (39").

	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small
	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to
	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through
	the insulation.

	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by
	solid wall coverings.

	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of
	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a
	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of
	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the
	wire.

	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.

	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will
	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like
	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of
	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground
	wiring section.]

 	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be
 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that
 	purpose.

	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through
	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed
	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this
	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses
	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.
	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.
	
 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,
 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the
 	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: "AC90" versus "AC".
	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.

	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes
	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.
	There are very different requirements for mobile homes.
	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything
	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?

	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable
	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box
	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic
	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.

	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable
	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still
	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also
	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.

	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for
	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground
	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other
	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For
	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.

Subject: Junction box positioning?

	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.

	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible
	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction
	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may
	get nasty.

Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?

	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few
	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage
	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half
	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire
	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle
	constraints as well.  For example, older house
	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess
	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the
	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.
	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high
	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your
	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case
	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)

	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some
	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and
	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy
	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box
	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling
	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available
	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and
	mounted between the joists.

	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as
	"pot" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated
	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.
	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated
	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a "coffin" (usually
	8'x16"x12" - made by making a pair of joists 12" high, and covering
	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*
	long)

	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"
	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.
	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,
	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.
	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't
	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector
	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get
	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown
	in later.]

	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and
	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are
	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat
	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should
	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.
	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location
	for the sensor can vary.

	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved
	for use in insulation.  The "coffin" appears the only legal approach.

Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?

	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is
	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up
	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with
	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can
	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in
	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions
	require the stove frame connected to neutral).

	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately
	and have them come and check out the problem.

	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with
	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A
	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness
	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.

Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?

	Three phase power has three "hot" wires, 120 degrees out of
	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors
	because it is more "efficient", provides a bit more starting torque,
	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.

	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows
	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between
	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal
	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the
	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.

	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually
	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you
	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to
	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is
	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have
	a "capacitor start" unit, or use a larger motor as a
	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if
	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to
	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an
	article on how to do this if you must.

	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using
	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.

Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?

	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there
	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply
	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times
	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also
	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor
	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the
	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.

	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more
	than 50 feet long.

Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?

	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746
	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,
	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200
	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,
	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational
	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.

	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router
	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far
	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a "stall
	horsepower" or similar.  That means the power is measured when
	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.
	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that
	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker
	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far
	more current than it can continuously.

	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This
	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,
	check the amperage rating, which is always present.

Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?

	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead
	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety
	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither
	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.

	There are several different approaches to solving this:
	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the
	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect
	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle
	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.
	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and
	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can
	       run a conductor to it from the third prong.
	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.
	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug
	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI
	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI
	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong
	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,
	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it
	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault
	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected
	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't
	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath
	       on BX cable.

	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three
	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.
	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.

Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?
	Should the test button work?

	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,
	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's
	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE
	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current
	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.
	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require
	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press
	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:
	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially
	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.

	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground
	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The
	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the
	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never
	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,
	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device
	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded
	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are
	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician
	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require
	it, and promised to investigate.)

Subject: How should I wire my shop?

	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all
	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies
	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the
	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for
	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or
	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have
	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp
	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles
	which means you'd have to "replug" all your equipment.  Lights
	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared
	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two
	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a
	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand
	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.

	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the
	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.
	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each
	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same
	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and
	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have
	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit
	wrong.

	Note that some jurisdictions have a "no horizontal wiring"
	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used
	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be
	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.

	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V
	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.
	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you
	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled
	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of
	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much
	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)

	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,
	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop
	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to
	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.
	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''
	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.
	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to
	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy
	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.

	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished
	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And
	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop
	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might
	have a different idea.

	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop
	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.

Subject: Underground Wiring

	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use
	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic
	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots
	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion
	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is
	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically
	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,
	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion
	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And
	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.

	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to
	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about
	your specific situation.

	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says "buried power
	line" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.

Subject: Aluminum wiring

	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became
	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,
	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,
	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.
	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new
	wiring.

	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum
	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.
	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper
	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential
	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.

	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as
	"cold creep".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When
	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes
	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each
	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes
	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance
	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/
	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,
	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even
	cause a fire.

	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move
	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of
	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing
	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you
	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring
	for the following things:

	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to
	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will
	       be stamped with "Al/Cu" or "CO/ALR".  The latter supersedes
	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat
	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.

	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around
	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be
	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the
	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug
	       up each connection.

	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the
	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.

	    3) "push-in" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.
	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with
	       the proper screw connections immediately.

	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,
	       melted insulation, or "baked" fixtures.  Any such damage should
	       be repaired.
	    
	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be
	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the
	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting
	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be
	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an
	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter
	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless
	       you can rent the tool.

	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring
	       by means of a short copper "pigtail".  See (5) above.
	    
	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped
	       (not nicked) wire etc.
    
	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring
	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider
	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,
	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,
	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having
	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.
	You can do this yourself too.

Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?

	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire
	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.
	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an
	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor
	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any
	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many
	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.

	Here's some hints on what to look for:

	Obvious non-code wiring can include:

		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls
		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without
		  proper marking.
		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of
		  a GFCI)
		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)
		- Switched neutrals
		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines

	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one
	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:

		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps
		   not properly terminated wiring)
		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are
		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when
		  it's *really* convenient ;-)
		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations
		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps
		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them
		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or
		  ceiling
		- Backwrapped grounding wires

Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring
	
	In the years since Edison "invented" electricity, several different
	wiring "styles" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you
	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old 
	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.

	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called
	"knob and tube" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with
	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural
	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).
	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections
	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping
	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,
	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs
	down the centre of each room, with "taps" off to each fixture.
	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some
	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same
	colour as the hot wires.

	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.

	Comments on K&T:

		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about
		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.
		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up
		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in
		  quite good condition.
		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.
		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with
		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,
		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.
		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between
		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to
		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on
		  any circuit.
		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls
		  that contain K&T.
		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be
		  tricky.  Consult your inspector.
		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more
		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.
	
	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't
	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should
	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and
	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly
	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on
	new circuits using modern techniques.
	
	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type
	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks
	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was
	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.
	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback
	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole
	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at
	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.

	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if
	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as
	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.
	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several
	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink
	tubing.

	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.
	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.
	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard
	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be
	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the "modern" stuff -
	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.

Subject: Where do I buy stuff?

	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their
	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or
	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety
	including the "odd" stuff, and have people behind the counter that
	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable
	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.

Well, that's the question, isn't it?  The goals are probably not all that
obvious.  We can set up a few goals, like happiness and liberty and
the golden rule, etc.  But these goals aren't inherent.  They have to
be defined before an objective system is possible.

It is not too difficult, one you have goals in mind, and absolute
knoweldge of everyone's intent, etc.

Omniscience is fine, as long as information is not given away.  Isn't
this the resolution of the free will problem?  An interactive omniscient
being changes the situation.

Well, I was speaking about an objective system in general.  I didn't
mention a specific goal, which would be necessary to determine the
morality of an action.

Seconded.   I cycle to work each day, and if we could just get
those damned cars and their cretinous drivers off the road, it
would be a lot more fun.

Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM
expansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to
the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion,
giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling
TechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc....

I would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the 
Mednews OCR/Scanner Fund.  We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard
Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:

John Sorenson
Carol Sigelman
Carla Moore
Barbara Moose
Judith Schrier

Again, thank you to all who gave!

I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to 
review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  
It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett 
Packard Scanners.  

When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; 
(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) 
automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. 

I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which 
parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.

Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The 
software gives you two "errors" at this point.  Blue which are words that were 
converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  
Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted 
correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more 
credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, 
you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal 
dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, 
considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. 

After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word 
processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a 
seperate TIFF or PCX file format.

I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use

an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  
While most of my faxes were received in "standard" mode (200x100 dpi), the 
accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. 

Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the 
limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just 
too small. 

If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

                                 Introduction

     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would 
soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain 
the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in 
the United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has 
been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., 
Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, 
Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences 
of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, 
malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, 
control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug 
resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, 
salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging 
infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those 
in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and 
minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of 
emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more 
effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 
(3). 
     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, "Emerging Infectious 
Diseases." Future articles will address these diseases, as well as 
surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and 
public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation 
of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).

            Update: Multistate Outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7
             Infections from Hamburgers -- Western United States,
                                   1992-1993
            =======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     From November 15, 1992, through February 28, 1993, more than 500 
laboratory-confirmed infections with E. coli O157:H7 and four associated 
deaths occurred in four states -- Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada. 
This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that 
identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from 
one restaurant chain. Washington 
     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of 
Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an 
increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a 
case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or 
postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls 
implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset 
(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January 
18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants 
was initiated. 
     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-
February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the 
state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case 
definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS 
(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with 
confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of 
symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A 
restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients 
who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating 
a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 
through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 
developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years 
(range: 0-74 years). Idaho 
     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-
confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December 
11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were 
hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 
(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California 
     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was 
notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. 
Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with 
E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. 
Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and

four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was 
reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% 
increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 
1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as 
postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, 
or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with 
onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. 
     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The 
outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen 
persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median 
age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of 
the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community 
controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched 
OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients 
who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-
sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). 
Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada 
     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten 
at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District 
issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea 
contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody 
diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness 
with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with 
onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local 
laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools 
for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After 
SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of 
one patient 38 days after illness onset. 
     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine 
were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: 
0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-
matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during 
the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence 
limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients 
also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-
49.8). Other Investigation Findings 
     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases 
primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November 
19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on 
November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 
lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed 
to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 
(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. 
     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the 
United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the

contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing 
the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter 
plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one 
slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. 
     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in 
families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first 
identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody 
diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since 
emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common 
cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked 
most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other 
food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been 
implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter 
study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 
that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 
participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a 
higher rate than for any other pathogen. 
     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most 
clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7

SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses 
associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea 
(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups 
and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and 
complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients 
develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. 
     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community 
outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite 
the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in 
three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington 
(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from 
persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). 
When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported 
to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public 
health action to prevent further cases. 
     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can 
contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify 
critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce 
the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. 
Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with 
pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens 
from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be 
internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook 
ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices 
are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played 
an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim 
recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 
155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). 
     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report 
and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be 
consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of 
outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of 
this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections 
caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. 
coli O157:H7.

            Use of Smokeless Tobacco Among Adults -- United States,
                                     1991
            =======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the 
United States almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1). Long-term use of 
smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of 
oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who 
currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). 
To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, 
CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease 
Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing 
tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This 
report summarizes findings from this survey. 
     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked "Have you used snuff at least 20 
times in your entire life?" and "Do you use snuff now?" Similar questions were 
asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of 
smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco 
use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the 
time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having 
used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the 
time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and 
former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at 
least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as 
those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not 
smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on 
smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or 
equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide 
national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using 
standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) 
(3). 
     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users 
of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) 
women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was 
highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was 
highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan 
Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American 
Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was 
substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in 
rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among

men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only 
for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). 
     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those 
aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of 
chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although 
women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest 
among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. 
     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being 
former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were 
former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons 
aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users 
(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% 
CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users 
was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% 
95% CI=68.9-78.1). 
     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) 
currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% 
CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% 
CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. 
     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 
95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-
49.6).

Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless 
tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in 
particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that 
link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral 
snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this 
behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for 
nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). 
     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among 
racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels 
and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require 
further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role 
in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the 
differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). 
     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current 
smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the 
prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco 
users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous 
study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked

occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked 
reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to 
stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health 
implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. 
     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special 
population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless 
tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 
2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more 
than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the 
prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless 
tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, 
enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes 
commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to 
routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based 
prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit 
tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,
I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or
spiritual explanations. 

It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood
as natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not
require us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,
for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.
However, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-
correcting, with nature as its judge. 

It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-
consistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer
a bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to
psychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe
from its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.

 There is no need
: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is
: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by
: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is
: determnined.

Actually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,
and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow
superdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have
any meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent
free will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their
perspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free
will or not? 

: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all
: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it
: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.

Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when
during the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control
one third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of 
numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates
and preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same
principle - only the systems that can start replicating will
survive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)

: For an atheist, no
: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less
: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-
: an event can have value. 

From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from
my perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have
a perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective
perspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if
I think about what it would it be like in their position, I will
eventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily
a gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.
Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity
is helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect
others who seem to have identity, too. 

Bill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)
for starters.

: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing
: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On
: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It
: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you
: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what
: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to
: establish your values.

C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why
he abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is
severely flawed.

Some values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some
others, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its
roots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real
possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic
behaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better
and better in building and using tools, they also became better
at killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could
only favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's
own people.

The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews
was not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people
together, under one god. Their god did not care much about people
of other nations. 

At the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews
were under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore
the Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along
with it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)

: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what
: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or
: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only
: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the
: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it
: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer
: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries
: no weight in any "absolute" sense.

It looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there
is an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may 
value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result
of some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer
comes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,
without any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their
meaning. 

It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of
view. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ 
personal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths
do not exist. 

The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others
is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence
by becoming social beings who can think and value others'
existence.

Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and
many other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have
sometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. 

: That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God
: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your
: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your
: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been
: conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your
: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.

The last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is
every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very
well, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism
is still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.

You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective
point of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,
_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,
has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point
of view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not
cease to be subjective. 

From a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither
does pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are 
inherently subjective. 

Once again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even
to make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if
we don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come
from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than
to make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god
gave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my
fault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the
point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's
own and then to get mad at this. 

God must be schizophrenic.

: All of this being so, you have excluded
: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,
: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no
: weight whatsoever.

Neither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand
why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way
less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.

Bill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,
_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his
own point of view, and his morals are his own.

But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was

the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily
concede that "ridiculous reasons" can play an important role in how
scientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with
methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the
majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.

Hi,

I've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few 
concerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing 
her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) 
and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every 
4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. 
As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that 
though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she 
mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 
weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had 
an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no 
problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain 
in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very 
difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or 
move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for 
when I do need to go out.) 

Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from 
the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about 
2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  
(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating 
very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well 
now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile 
related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my 
upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I 
was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because 
it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  
no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I 
ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had 
turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if 
I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it 
wasn't as much of a problem.

So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid 
fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware 
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have 
been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat 
foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  

But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat 
except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, 
fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I 
should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only 
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( 
potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in 
a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or 
steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have 
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if 
I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it 
from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if 
she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her 
recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on 
cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She 
originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the 
entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I 
started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and 
she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also 
asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them 
are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, 
and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did 
want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be 
temporary for that one week. 

What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I 
would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying 
that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she 
assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that 
because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to 
use the energy from the food I do eat. 

Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm 
truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet 
because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few 
minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I 
don't find any foods satisfying.

Thanks

Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:
djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
 
I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have
two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one
screen.
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within
driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction.
 
Details:
 
Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:
---------------------------------------------------
 
**SOLD**
 
Sony 1304 14" color monitor:
----------------------------
What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,
Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).
It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,
and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.
 
Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not
including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable.
 
 
RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"
monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode
(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a
RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg
SIMMS).
 
Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking
**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and
packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer"
for these items.
 
------------
 
Cheers.

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from
various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]

The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course),
and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data.
Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points
between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more
complicated.

Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective"
sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of
all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias
filtering.

By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned
physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down 
into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by
increasing intra-abdominal pressure....
Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only 
detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal. 
Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous
operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best
position to make that determination.

Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then 
folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far
too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.

Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are
different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much
recent evidence for this statement is present in the book "Brainsex" by
Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.
Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic
and is well referenced. 

Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only
adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are
different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women
are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into
account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules
it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this
instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of
where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!

Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.
However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. 
Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same
extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a
man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And
therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,
NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.

Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the
sexism here just reflects the "sexism" of nature in making men and women
different.  There are many other differences between men and women which
are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I
recommend you have a look at the book "Brainsex".

Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.
If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically
become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for
pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --
so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You
are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that 
women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports
my statement that maternity leave is sexist.

There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is
taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and
female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from
early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized
in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.

You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and
I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I
recently reposted something here under the heading "Islam and Women" --
if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted
from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it
still might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title

Your statement that "other religions are no different" is, I think, a
statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than
Christianity and perhaps Judaism.

Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also
was, at one stage, a military leader.

The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the "Hijra" (the
Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.

Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your
viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.

I don't know if anyone knows about this topic: electrical heart 
failure. One of my friends has had to go to the doctor because
he had chest pains. The Doc said it was Arythmia. So he had to
go to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated. His
doctors said that he could die from it, and the medication caused
cancer ( that he was taking). Well, I suggested that he run, excersize
and eat more, ( he is very skinny) but he says that has nothing
to do with it. Does anyone know what causes arythmia and how 
it can be treated?

But why do you characterize this as a "flight of fancy" or a "fantasy"?
While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious
that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This
does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of
fancy or a fantasy.

Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also,
"extra-scientific", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of
rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble
over what a "surprising" experiment is, what counts as "surprising", etc.
The same may be said about "logical grounds".  My point is that quite frequently
(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to
previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of
some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples
such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"
hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) "surprising"?
Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must
be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)
out of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and
well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.
The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty
at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one
could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new
domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you
like.

Hi everyone,

I thought that some people may be interested in my VR
software on these groups:

*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******

Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality
system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.

Features:

   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.
   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).
   Generic clients.
   Customizable servers.
   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).
   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).
   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily
        attached.

Functionality:

  Client:
   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things
   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's
   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's
   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to
   other users.

   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to
   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that
   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting
   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.

   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:

    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)

    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)

    o User Interface Panels

    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for
	faster frame rates)

    o Mouse and Keyboard Input

   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the
   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because
   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)

  Server(s):
   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is
   provided in this release for potential world server developers:

    o Transparent Client Management

    o Client Message Handling

   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of
accepting and
   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the
application writer
   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.

   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is
   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:

    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:
        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended
        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension
        initialisers you want.

    o Event Handler Registration:
        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback
        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.
        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)

    o Collision Detection Registration:
        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide
        some basic information to the collision detection management software.
        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.

    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because
    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects
    from which to choose.

    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:

    o Provide an initWorld function:
        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus
        any initialization you want to do.

    o Provide a positionObject function:
        This is where you determine where to place a new client.

    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:
        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.

    o Provide a getWorldType function:
        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.

    o Provide an animateWorld function:
        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects
        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit
        (to avoid outrunning the clients).

    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the
    three world servers I've provided:

        generic - 81 lines
        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the
                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future
                           versions)
        dogfight - 72 lines

Location:

   This software is located at the following site:
   ftp.u.washington.edu

   Directory:
   pub/virtual-worlds

   File:
   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z

Futures:

   Client:

    o Texture mapping.

    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading

    o HMD support.

    o Etc, etc....

   Server:

    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).

    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction

    o Etc, etc....

   Both:

    o Improved Comms!!!

I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse
software,
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure
whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(

I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of
the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I
would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

Finally one major disclaimer:

This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code
other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure
desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad
that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Disclaimer over!

Of course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with
POSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who
hates it: > /dev/null!

Not in a clock-doubled system. There isn't a doubling in performance, but
it _is_ quite significant. Maybe about a 70% increase in performance.

Besides, for 0 wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway. I mean,
who uses a processor that runs at the speed of 80ns SIMMs? Note that this
memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 12.5 MHz.

Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US 
has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada 
from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion 
of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  
Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess 
we "invaded" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have 
invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles 
for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from 
Spain.

So if you mean by the word "invaded" some sort of military action where
we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally
"invaded" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.
(If some nation "invades" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be
invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of
view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).

No, it's someone who believes in "peace-at-all-costs".  In other words,
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and
Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one
who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.

"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik," you ask?  Well, it depends
on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over
freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's "bad" to be a peace-nik.

The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be "bad" and "unconscionable".  I would not have any
argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with 
the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank
hypocrisy!)  All to stop we "warmongers" who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense.

Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)

Where did you read this?  I don't think this is true.  I think most
medical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult
to prove anything with certitude.  It is true that there are some
things that have just been found "to work", but we have no good
explanation for why.  But almost everything does have a scientific
rationale.  The most common treatment for prostate cancer is
probably hormone therapy.  It has been "proven" to work.  So have
radiation and chemotherapy.  What treatments did the article say
are not proven?

Note that I _never_ said that depression and the destruction of the
nuclear family is due _solely_ to extra-marital sex.  I specifically
said that it was "a prime cause" of this, not "the prime cause" or "the
only cause" of this -- I recognize that there are probably other factors
too, but I think that extra-marital sex and subsequent destabilization
of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in
psychological problems, including depression, in the West in the 20th
century.

And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide the
world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.

If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and
have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural
being is your criterion.

But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept-
ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you 
are - I assume - worried about.

And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical,
critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and
easily led on the other.

I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief 
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
beside the point.

Actually, a lot of this work used to be done with a CRT that had a beamsplitter
mounted in front, and a tachistoscope driving it.  The tachistoscope is really
just a slide projector with a very fast shutter.  Low tech, but it does the job.

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:
 
Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)
 
I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.
 
My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

Sorry.   Wrong.    This is how banks got started in the first place.
Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone
who eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they
havn't been managing risk very well.   Then they will ask themselves
what it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers
not to take on greater loans than they can carry.    And since they
don't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the
money, some of them will specialise in that.

Then they'll reinvent interest, but like good Muslims, they'll call
it something else.

Riiiight.   That's why John Major opened a new government department

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Where
exactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?
ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along
with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name
a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices.  

A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design
Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered
to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I
don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isn't going to make that much difference

If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...
TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.

Hi Noel,

I've made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts,
triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic
3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which
triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited
to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code
example of how to do it.

Another way to do the bartman may be

- TGA2POV
- A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.

  Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript
  previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,
  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open
  on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.

Example:

object {
   union {
      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" }
      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" scale <1 -1 1>}
   }
   texture {
      Glass
   }
   translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center
   rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards
   scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker
   translate <0 2 0>            // final placement
}


abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing "ABP" black on white in
Times-Roman 256 points.

I'm not saying this at all - it requires no faith on my part to
say the car drives because I've seen it drive - I've done more
than at in fact - I've actually driven it. (now what does require
some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation
of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con -
for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to
say below on this).

Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a
conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God
is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence 
of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something 
(the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they 
disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never 
seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The "pink unicorn" analogy breaks
down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the 
appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that 
"pink unicorns" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion
has it's foundation in observation and theory. A "pink unicorn", if
it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.
That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has
evolved from "more primitive" ancestors these pink unicorns would share 
a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however,
has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical
frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.

I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as
existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be
getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant
we can come back to it.

You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand
what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no
definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of
anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate
to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you
that they can logically prove God or that they have "evidence" or ...,
then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).

BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not
EVEN wrong.

I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of
things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one
cannot use observation to infer that "God does not exist". Such
a positive assertion requires a leap.

Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no
EVIDENCE that "'god is' is meaningful" at ANY level. Maybe such
a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so
many people try to run their own private conception of God down
your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and
only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something
for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against
requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a
"theist"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect -
but it must be founded upon honesty.

I can't say for sure with the IIvx -> C650 upgrade, but I wondered the
same thing when I ordered my LC -> LC III upgrade.  Turns out the "upgrade"
is actually an entire CPU minus any disk drives.  You pull the floppy and
hard drives out of the old one, stick them in the new one, and you've got
an LC III.

The IIvx -> C650 may be the same thing.

It might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that
Apple only sells Macs pre-packaged with the drives.  Of course, the price
is quite a bit higher without the trade-in...

Reading this definition, I wonder: when should you recognize something

discoveries of such previous mistakes they accept.

No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don't need any excess information
other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively
determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.
I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that
everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that
it cannot be objective in theory.

>your comments about lions, and mine.

Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,
the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely
the only ones to be considered "immoral" under the previous "definitions"
of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the
class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.

It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system
because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would
necessitate some sort of grand design?

I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired
behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,
or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,
immoral to what end?).

Please get it right, Jon.
(This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes,
 because the NFs of this world are fouling the once-pristine NT
 intellectual nest with their verbal poop.)

The dominant correlation is NT <-> Phlegmatic (and _not_ NT <-> Choleric).
One of the semantic roots of "choleric" is the idea of "hot" (emotional)
and one of the semantic roots of "phlegmatic" is "cold" (unemotional).

Perhaps in serious pediatics and "my little boy's got a runny

Yes, and everyone thinks as you do.  No one thinks that he is going to cause
or be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high.
Just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting
blanks does not mean that you are less guilty.

You mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation?  And, you should
note that that situation will never occur.  There are always other options
thank killing.  Why don't you just say that all killing is wrong.  This
is basically what you are saying.

But, most people have found the risk to be acceptable.  You are probably
much more likely to die in a plane crash, or even using an electric
blender, than you are to be executed as an innocent.  I personally think
that the risk is acceptable, but in an ideal moral system, no such risk
is acceptable.  "Acceptable" is the fudge factor necessary in such an
approximation to the ideal.

And to add further fuel to the flame war, I read about 20 years ago that
the "natural" MSG - extracted from the sources you mention above - does not

    INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language
courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and 
Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses 
each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin 
June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours 
per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  
Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact 
Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology
Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or
address below.  
ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

#################   New Program Announcement   ########################
#######################################################################


            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and 
January 1994.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:

1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time.

2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,
Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.


3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,
and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

motivated, and I'm saying that's wrong.   I'm not saying that
each and every killing is religiously motivate, as I spelled out

Originator: dmp@eagle

A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result of
trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is under
control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.

Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but
isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but
this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend
has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the
effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.

As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in
one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that
tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of
the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is
quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment
to relieve it.

The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is
now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some
of the pain from the tendonitis.

My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).


If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative
courses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely
grateful if you could e-mail to me.  If anyone is interested, I'll post a
summary to this newsgroup.

thanks in advance,

Thanks to aldridge@netcom.com, I now know a bit more about Stargardt's
disease, aka juvenile macular distrophy, but I would like to learn more.

First, what is the general prognosis - is blindness the result?
Second, what treatments, if any, are available?

Unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts.  The most common method of
implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  The
local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via
the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great
care.

For a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.
The author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local
oscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for British
Intelligence.

Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having
one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian,
in his reply to my original posting.
I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer,
comp.graphics.hw_and_sw
The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you
say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day.
I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or 
three I'm interested in.

I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one
meeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas,
help others or to be helped. I think this is difficult to achive if there
are so many different things in one meeting.

The GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  I'm glad that Adcom had
the guts to not over-do the packaging.  It irks me when I see
audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably
cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they

I don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which
something is assembled.  This is especially true for something as

I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as
hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not
be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by 
figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought
"virtually impossible to test for."

Indeed, I would be surprised if "candida overbloom" were such a
phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature
byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the 
extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite 
tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient
or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as 
"virtually impossible."

FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to
what the group is for......


A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....

This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),
antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and
so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned.

Oh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderated...too bad.

Oh well, obviously, no one really cares.

I had the same question for my 55lb NEC 5FG monitor. The Apple guy said that
their 50lb 16" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment
beyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to 
thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight
would be more concentrated than with Apple's (I don't know the area of the 
base of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle.
So I cut a piece of 3/8" thick wood to about 16.25" x 12", covered it in a 
cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top
and the monitor!!

The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization 
can end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the
bench.  Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the
lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it
(as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but 
stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review 
committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's 
what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to.
Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at 
least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to
ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with 
fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project
that actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem to 
be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.

I have to agree with Gary Merrill's response to this.  I've read alot of the
Alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting, 
good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.  It's 
really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but
this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.
I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their
8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram
that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller
chips that "create static RAM appearance" and all that, but they may
be too expensive to make it worthwhile.

Hi,

1. How VESA standard works?  Any documentation for VESA standard?

2. At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,
   where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold
   all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation?  I
   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know
   nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?  

3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called
   SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the
   above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?


  Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questions

CPU plus the powercache.  This leavese the PDS slot open for a video card.
Currenty, DayStar does not have the '040 in this configuration, but it is
due out early next year.  With their upgrade policy, you can get the '030
accelerator now, and when the '040 version becomes available, you get
credit
for the one you have.  

I am running their 50 MHz version with FPU along with a Radius Precision
Color Pivot and I'm very satisfied.

Ah, the verb "to must".   I was warned about that one back

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent
toner, like HP's "Microfine" stuff) don't.  Both produce very good output,
but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet
output is definitely superior.  

On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use
the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much
worse than a bubblejet. :-)

One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good
looking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets.

P.S. -- If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although I've heard the portable
Canons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).  With the DeskJet
Portable, you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot!

I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in
this thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand
on two of her comments.

In article <C5JoDH.9IG@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes:

One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning
about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,
scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of
evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the
back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be
filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a
grave mistake to confuse these.

Past snippets from this thread:

>>> I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....

>> one in which it does not. ...

Back to Lee Lady:

> These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and

These posters are making the mistake that I have previously
criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A "carefully
designed and controlled study" is neither always possible nor
always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a
remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we
have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind
of claim to ask for a "carefully designed and controlled study"
to alleviate our skepticism.)

Rules such as "support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and
controlled study" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.
I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be
convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have
occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To
reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from
uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical
problems are notoriously problematic.)

======================================================================

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
=====================

    Artists, designers, scientists, engineers and educators share the
    problem of moving information from one mind to another.
    Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,
    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing
    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well
    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far
    exceed their technical skills.

    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression
    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and
    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the
    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of
    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar
    representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"

    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and
    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by
    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media
    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic
    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for
    composing imagery for understanding.

    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a
    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the
    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,
    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and
    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the
    computer graphics context.

Subject: Re: Help with ultra-long timing
Organization: University of Kansas Academic Computing Services
Lines: 33

Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a
couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.
spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C
and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time
delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this
application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.
When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x
the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it
is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K
resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of
2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)
Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for
256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.
After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14
day timing cycle and so forth.

Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts
to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see
what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that
has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns
off ;-)

Thanks again everyone...

OTOH, some of us get lucky-- I've unplugged and replugged SCSI and ADB
quite often, and never blown anything.  I blew out the ADB by shorting
the cable, though.

The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem, it was heavily
discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a
one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's (at least the
700
and 900).  System 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the 
solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  In my
case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
Quadra
700, all that occured early last year.

You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about
his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book
"Orientalism" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,
not a Muslim.

Regarding Bernard Lewis:

Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his
giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.

Read "Orientalism" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.

In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).

I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and
have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his
political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic
polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based
on telling half-truths.

Again, read "Orientalism" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take
what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get
this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for
_yourself_.

If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some
Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual
purposes is necessarily opposed too.

I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_
who are not getting through to _you_.

Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.

Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,
showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been
completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a
very good one, under the title "Islam and Women", reposted from
soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,
then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this
excellent article.  

IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.

Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,
which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based
completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and
hadiths to support its point of view.

Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical
standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an
and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform
a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is
part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of
course not.

Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for
you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says "I am a
Muslim" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean
that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and
only an idiot would think so.

Do you see my point?

You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an
ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise
their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.
To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --
Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be
capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a
free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of 
capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)

>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.
>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education

One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is
because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.

Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the
fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that
Islam => lack of education and power.

For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a
significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in
the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is
completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history
shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be
other reasons for this situation.

>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims 
>for following the Quran. 

Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent
of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not
knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are
following the Qur'an or not.

>Your idea is baseless from historical
>facts, it is a poor utopia, 

The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one
stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by "following the Qur'an"
that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis
that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical
fact which contradicts your theory. 

>while my ideas are derived from social
>and economic history. 

You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.
So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is
quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views
makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of
this.

>My solution to all Muslims is simple:
>CUT THE CRAP, 

I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.

>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT 

Here too.

>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE
>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.

Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate
ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly
with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I
think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!

Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that
you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start
thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our
postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously
have.

	Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your
mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big
current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output
nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.

(nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about
50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)

	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest,
6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company
name.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,
mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a
1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals.
If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info.

	Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida.
Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like 
nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices,
so they might be able to help you out.

	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.
The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd
need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......

  A 256K DRAM chip is a 256 kilobit chip whereas a 256K SIMM is a 256
kilobyte memory module. The SIMM is a PCB with a 30 pin connector edge
and on the SIMM are 8 256 kilobit DRAM chips (making the total memory 256
KBytes.
 
  You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter.
Apple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or
special memory chips. Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what
kind of chips you need.

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are
1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than
nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many
fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many
fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were
adopted ("why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.").  
3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally
not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil
plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants
of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the 
heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in
order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is
normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is
desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because 
moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine 
low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity
causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest
pressure condensing environment is always the best.  

A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where
the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the
condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the 
condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too 
hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into
steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a
particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all
costs.  

The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant
in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower 
they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in
the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 
degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is
used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower
system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water
is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,
operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order 
to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher
hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the
condenser area.

At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the
air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge
water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water
from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and
humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water
temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical
"95-95" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.
It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful
in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the
plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets
too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive
pressure.

True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and
feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard 
stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.
The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood
the costs of impure water.  By "impure", I mean water with a few
dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved
oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will 
find outside the laboratory.

I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private
Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye.

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA
compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up
and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background.

I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly
used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.

Do you know what a bi-metallic strip is?
Just in case: it is two strips of different metals bonded together, which 
when heated bend to one side (check out the blinker globe in your 
christmas tree lights).

So when you turn on the power, this causes the bulb to work like a neon, 
heating up and shorting out, thus providing a loop to power the heaters in 
the main tube. When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the 
starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out 
(O/C).

BTW, I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon, so one 
day when the neon in my sisters digital (flip the metal squares type) 
clock broke (flimsy leads), I replaced it with one from a starter. Well 
powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock!

As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near
the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope)
exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a
friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.

Hope this helps.

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.

Good UV ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by
getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.

Even the 68000 can fetch two bytes at a time.

The new instruction in the 68040 is MOVE16 which fetches 16 bytes
at a time instead of 4 which the 68030 has; that means 4 24bit
pixels instead of one.

Yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  You somehow left 
out the part about "we all ate the same thing."  Changes things a bit, eh?

You complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown and
therefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable to
defend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.

Pepper makes me sneeze.  If it doesn't affect you the same way, fine.

I don't react to scallops, but did have discomforts with clam juice
served at (American) waterfront seafood bars.  I don't know whether
the juice is homemade or from cans.

The following is my first encounter with the Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome.  Ten years ago, about an hour after having Won Ton Soup I
collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up, my scalp
tingling, my feet too weak to stand up.  The symptoms lasted for about
20 minutes.  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction, I
went back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  The
same thing happened.  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing
out of the ordinary.

I've also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant.

But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips
you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at
200 MHz.

But the 68040 is (or will soon be) available in 40 MHz version,

I think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle. Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTE-oriented (longest Intel instruction
is 15 bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any
intelligent memory subsystem.

                    LOW LEVELS OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES LINKED
                           TO SERIOUS ASTHMA ATTACKS
                           American Lung Association 

     A new study published by the American Lung Association has shown that 
surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with 
asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment.  
     The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits 
for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.  
The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed 
unsafe under federal air quality laws.  
     "People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to 
exacerbate that inflammation," said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  "When people are on 
the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over 
the edge." 
     The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits 
with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because 
they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of 
compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 
exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  
     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at 
levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 
microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with 
asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  
     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory 
Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung 
Association's medical section.  
     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that 
particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study 
by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles 
may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  
Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms 
and bronchitis in children.  
     "Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone," 
says Dr. Schwartz.  "But more and more research is showing that particles are 
bad actors as well."      One problem in setting, standards for particulate 
air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated 
pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex 
and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29

acid aerosols.  
     "Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects 
of particulate air pollution," says Dr. Schwartz.  "We have no way of 
duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  " Consequently, most of what 
is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research 
like the Seattle study.  
     Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur 
dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any 
time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with 
asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.
     "In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only 
cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's 
rarely particulate matter," says Dr.  Schwartz.  "However, PM10 doesn't have 
to be near its violation range to be unhealthy."

               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in 
dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance 
techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care 
professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological 
characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, 
and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi 
and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in 
preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of 
presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel 
weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement. 
 
Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a 
distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; 
(2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential 
for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical 
excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and 
extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) 
patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high 
risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; 
(5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for 
melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education 
and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality 
from melanoma.

of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily 
in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on 
clinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a 
multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community 
outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer 
prevention and control research. 
 
Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was 
the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new 
cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage 
of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened 
the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and 
cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew 
progressively. 
 
In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, 
there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria 
for comprehensive status. 
 
To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an 
institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly 
established in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include the 
requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in 
several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong 
program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings 
into clinical practice. 
 
Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly 
beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also 
referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting 
the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass 
strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, 
significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important 
outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of 
sources. 
 
The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and 
capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit 
important new findings or address timely research questions.

Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  
These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers 
engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators 
and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications 
from new discoveries in the laboratory. 
 
Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and 
clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently 
incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their 
overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. 
 
Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely 
structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and 
control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health 
departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention 
and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions 
responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  
Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with 
institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community 
hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. 
 
Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward 
creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through 
interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the 
laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

                 THE UCI MEDICAL EDUCATION SOFTWARE REPOSITORY 

This is to announce the establishment of an FTP site at the University of 
California, for the collection of shareware, public-domain software and other 
information relating to Medical Education.  

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse 
for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical 
education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with 
other users.  

To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to: 

                     FTP.UCI.EDU

The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope 
to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).  

Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you 
have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education 
efforts, either as an instructor or student.  

Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either 
the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the 
mode to binary and "send" or "put" your files.  Note that you won't be able to 
see the files with the "ls" or "dir" commands.  Please compress your files as 
appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something 
similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.  

After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for 
MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you 
have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.

Note that we can only accept software or information that has been designated 
as shareware, public-domain or that may otherwise be distributed freely.  
Please do not upload commercial software!  Doing so may jeopardize the 
existence of this FTP site.  

If you wish to upload software for other operating systems, please contact 
either Steve Clancy, M.L.S. or Albert Saisho, M.D. at the addresses above.

"NIH Set to Test Multiple AIDS Vaccines" Reuters (04/08/93)  (Frank, 
Jacqueline) 

     Washington--The Clinton administration will permit the National  
Institutes of Health to test multiple AIDS vaccines instead of  only allowing 
the Army to test a single vaccine, administration  sources said Thursday.  The 
decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to 
test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of 
Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the 
therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies 
including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH 
that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is 
intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  
replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's 
reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the 
MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  
"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the 
next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project," said Shalala.   
Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine 
Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had 
convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested 
simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of 
multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two 
years.

"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. 
114, No. 14, P. 18 

     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, 
the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the 
drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that 
although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk 
of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  
disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of 
the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the 
drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. 
researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, 
many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients 
experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  
AIDS symptoms.  In addition, researchers have long been familiar  with the

Hello all.
	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.
	I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that
can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an
old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-
back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the
Micron Xceed) ?
	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards
the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)
but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?

Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.

I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order
companys that sell monitors or cards.

Thanks in advance

    Don't believe the hype. There is no such thing as a PowerPC slot.

Hey, now will you stop encouraging him? Copy protection only serves one pur-
pose: to keep the honest buyer from making (legal) backup copies. It will
definitely not stop any pirates. If you want to protect you soft, supply a
good documentation and support. This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively pro-
tecting software.

Arno

Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  The
final diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.
(Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a
military dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments
as part of its regular health care.)  I am hoping that the arrival of (1)
Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY*
she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it
seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(

Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for
spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.

Thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.

display HDF image files ? I've had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA 
and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage
approaches and minimalist documentation :-)

Part of the problem is that I want to look at large (5MB+) HDF files and
crop out a section. Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from
which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped
part into another format for viewing/animation.

Otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation S/W
for HDF (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. This is for
Suns with SunOS 4.1.2.

Any help GREATLY appreciated. Ta muchly !

Cheers,
	Markus

I have a friend who has a very pronounced slouch of his upper back. He
always walks and sits this way so I have concluded that he is
hunchback.
Is this a genetic disorder, or is it something that people can correct.
i.e. is it just bad posture that can be changed with a bit of will
power?

I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive
on its side.  The point is this will only be sure to work on the 'new'
drives, namely 1/3 ht LPS drives that have a smaller platter and are also
more stable.
	Why should I take the chance?  Because I've been running a Maxtor 1/3 ht
120 LPS on both its side and flat for about a year and I've had no
problems with it.  Period.

Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap
will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in
applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their
performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.
The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,
so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering
the cold).

You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,
that "rolls over" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every
1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would
need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the
firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz
oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator
remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.

I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the
solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.

Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't
guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable
conditions.

It's about time.  Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention
to the bible, anyway?

Face it, there are better things to do with your life!  I used to
chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity
of people believing in it as truth, etc.  Why do we spend so little
time on the Mayan religion, or the Native Americans?  Heck, the Native
Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what
about the Egyptians.

I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept
it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which I find more accurate.


I try to be tolerant.  It gets very hard when someone places a book
under my nose and tells me it's special.  It's not.

I don't think speed has been determined, since it has never run on Intel chips.

In terms of features, and learning curve... ALL that you stated for 3DS is also
true for Imagine, and lots more... But I'll have to admit that after 3 years of

When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving,
communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often
interpreted as the much weaker term religion. 

The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews,
Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a
din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social
code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict,
etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent
those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other
Mushriq, or roughly polytheists. 

There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community,
that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate 
the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or "Progress is 
the natural consequence of Human activity" or "parlamentarian
democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government", however 
they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point
of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. 
"We are a atheist society" in fact means "we reject the din other than
ours". 

Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/
suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that
is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such
deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of
looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level. 

I think it took more than one minute.

Every time somone writes something and says it is merely describing the norm,
it is infact re-inforcing that norm upon those programmed not to think for

Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large
capacity devices. The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but
it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge
it. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room for
expansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25",
a 3.5", a tape drive, and a MO drive, all on the floppy interface. The
possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous).

CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the "Enter Number:" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds "Call Complete," enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the "Username:" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called "Earth Sciences Resources on Internet",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name "internet.resources.earth.sci"

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:
   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics
   1600 Indiana Ave.
   Winter Park, FL 32789
   Phone: (407) 384-9484
   FAX: (407) 647-7242

b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.
   Written by Steve Worley.

[ What about Texture City ?? ]

==========================================================================

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in
  "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]

========================================================================

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware

IDL/SIPS
--------
  "A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it"

  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) "

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called "GVLware".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a "Brick of Bytes", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level
  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send
  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of
  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in
  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the
  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,
  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass
  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send
  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI
  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from
  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default
  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different
  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to
  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI "database").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"
  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

Sci.E(E) netters:

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so 
cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
1000-10,000.

Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
quantity.

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This 
$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor 
chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.

P.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone else 
had better luck with this strategy?

They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution.  They

But we were discussing it in relation to the death penalty.  And, the
Constitution need not define each of the words within.  Anyone who doesn't

    as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this

then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually
steam) VERY HOT.

   I remember seeing this at Con Edison's Indian Point #1 power plant,

I know from personal experience that men CAN get yeast infections. I 
get rather nasty ones from time to time, mostly in the area of the
scrotum and the base of the penis. They're nowhere near as dangerous
for me as for many women, but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime!
Even in the wintertime, when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there. The

Shades of James Watson!  That's exactly the way many workers have described
their misgivings about the Human Genome Project.  If you take a rigid 
definition of scientific research, the mere accumulation of data is not 
doing science.  One of the early arguments against the project were that the 
resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related 
problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.  
The project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.

      So long as you keep that "almost" in there, freedom will be a
mostly valuable thing, to most people. That is, I think you're really
saying, "a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable
to them". That's good, and a quite nice starting point for a moral

Originator: dgj2y@kelvin.seas.Virginia.EDU
Organization: University of Virginia
Lines: 35


	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile
I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there
seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,
I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
random 50mV bias.
	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output
won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed
from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input
impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have
maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have
input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to
use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing
reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my
circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.
With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now
with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of
a pain in  the ass.
	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator
input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd
like to have this box not be active.
	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I
had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The
function generator was the same way on that one, too.

Indeed, an extreme example.  It came "out of nowhere."  The connection
Kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary.
I, for example, often receive/conjure solutions (hypotheses for solutions) 
to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupied 
with activities quite removed.  Algorithms for that new software feature come
when I trample the meadow on my occasional runs.  Alternative (better>) ways 
to instruct and rear my sons arrive while I weed the garden.  I'll swear I am 
not thinking about any of it when ideas come.   

These ideas are not the stuff of "great" discoveries, of course, but my
connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and
occasional fits of rationality.

Yes.  And he was lucky to have such a colorful, vivid image.  I, alas, will

Dyer, you're rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's
often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of
non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,
but it's still no more than a guess.
It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who don't respond.

There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many
diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology
sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have
run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental
method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine
doesn't have all the answers.

This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a
miracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?  

You might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging
attack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you
r beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.

If this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just
exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple.

Whether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or
not, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear
of their life for words.

It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the
worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that?
You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you
quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support
threatening the life of someone for words, you are not yet civilized.

This is exactly where I, and many of the people I know, have to depart
from respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and
encourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.

You, or I or anyone, are more than privledged to believe that someone,
whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover, is beyond the pale
of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul, refuse to allow
any members of your association to interact with him/her, _peacably_
demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from
the "miscreants", or whatever, short of physical force.

But once you physically threaten, or support physical threats, you get
much closer to your earlier comparison of rape - with YOU as the rapist
who whines "She asked for it, look how she was dressed".

Blaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesn't fly.

Speaking of Psygnosis, they have licensed games to Philips Interative
Media International for CD-I.

The following was recently posted in a message in the CD-I section of
the Multimedia Forum.

"Seventh Guest has been licensed by Virgin Games to Philips Interactive
Media International for worldwide CD-I rights. Were also licensed to
P.I.M.I. Litil Divil from Gremlin Graphics (UK) and Microcosm from
Psygnosis (UK). Those three titles will be adapted on CD-I using the full
potential of the FMV cartridge, meaning, using the additional memory as
well as the motion video capabilities. Those titles have been negociated
in Europe but will be available worldwide.

Also, Lemmings 1 & 2 have been licensed from Psygnosis, as well as Striker
Soccer from Rage (UK)."

I don't know when these titles will be available or when work on them even
started (so don't expect your CD-I retailer to have them yet).

There was also some mention of future Nintendo CD-I games in an issue of the
UK magazine ERT - Mario Hotel was mentioned as having 75 levels.

I don't know about the Instrutech boards (though I plan to check them out),
but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S/N ratio of
many of the "16 bit" boards out there. The NI boards are very clearly
specified in terms of monotonicity, S/N ratio, accuracy, etc; and the
NB-A2100 and NB-A2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
distortion that you'd expect from a good, true 16 bit converter. This is
not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example.

	Two thoughts.

	- I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next 
generation to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown
upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that.
Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation
we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.

	- Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't
be the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.

Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness

Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set:
This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.  

DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set

120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
       !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
                           !

modified set for 2 level brightness:

                string 1
120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
  \_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
    5w    !      string 2     !
          b   ________________!
120v rtn__!___!

             ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.

Only one blinker is used.

Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the
string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in
parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor
here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the
current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing
and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,
this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the
strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  
Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get
one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these
draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.

What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light 
at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current 
from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing 
both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a 
low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow 
at reduced brightness. 

Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires 
in a safe manner!

NNTP-Posting-Host: cmb00.larc.nasa.gov

I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in
network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going
to describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced
a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted
Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like
this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the
family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision
was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.

Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had
a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am
embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once
in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is the
same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Ten 
minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure
to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.

When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for
the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now
after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even
he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I
understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.

Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good
to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any
experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical
community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and
foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can
guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas
anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get
across what is going on here.

Thanks.

This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction
between real disease caused by Candida albicans and the "disease"
that was being asked about, systemic yeast syndrome.

There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush.  It also
seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous
may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- I've 
never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before (though 
presumably it would work by the same mechanism).

Candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major
pathogen.  That does not mean that there is evidence that it causes
the "systemic yeast syndrome".

The CD300 (external) is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile  
now.  Demand for the units are high, so they are pretty rare.  I've seen them  
listed for around $525-550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac  
reseller.  I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's,  
but I can't confirm it.

Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered
hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope.
Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of
a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular
lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since
it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes,
and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy
breadtubes. Some people believe that food is the way to a man's heart,
but most psychics agree that there is nothing like hot Crullers for
breakfast; the chemical composition of crullers is a mystery, some
thought evidence of Charles Fort's channeling in Stevie Wonder's
production of "The Secret Life of Plants" when played backwards in the
theatre of unnaturally fertile Findhorn Farms has deduced that they
are complex carbohydrates ordinarily only found by spectoscopy in the
Magellenic Clouds. I called Devi on my Orgone Box and asked her if
this was really the case, and she TM levitated me a letter across the
Atlantic to tell me it was indeed not just another case of
misunderstanding Tesla, though the Miskatonic University hasn't
confirmed anything at all. At least the Crullers taste good; I got the

No, Bobby.  Stalin killed millions in the name of Socialism.  Atheism was a
characteristic of the Lenin-Stalin version of Socialism, nothing more.
Another characteristic of Lenin-Stalin Socialism was the centralization of
food distribution.  Would you therefore say that Stalin and Lenin killed
millions in the name of rationing bread?  Of course not.


>More horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything else.

In earlier posts you stated that true (Muslim) believers were incapable of
evil.  I suppose if you believe that, you could reason that no one has ever
been killed in the name of religion.  What a perfect world you live in,
Bobby.  


>One of the reasons that you are atheist is that you limit God by giving
>God a form.  God does not have a "face".

Bobby is referring to a rather obscure law in _The Good Atheist's 
Handbook_:

Law XXVI.A.3: Give that which you do not believe in a face.  

You must excuse us, Bobby.  When we argue against theism, we usually argue
against the Christian idea of God.  In the realm of Christianity, man was
created in God's image.

My MacClassic mouse died.  I dissected it and determined that it is
the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed
mode.  This tragedy prompts the following questions:

1.	Is it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into the
	place of the old switch ?

2.	I have old mice (Max+, Mac 512Ke), can they be used with some

I had a GE Emerson 13" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day,
while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause),
we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound,
so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV.
The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
(we wanted a bigger one too!).
 After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but
not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?
 I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any
idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).

You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs;  512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any 
of the Quadra or Centris machines.  There is already 512K of VRAM soldered 
to the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a

A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the
plane (it may require you to give it a "cut" though...)

E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch
having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular
Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch)
are "developable". In more technical words, a developable surface is
"locally isometric to a plane" at all points.


Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable:
whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces
of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry
which treats surfaces (2D manifolds); e.g., M. do Carmo's book:

@Book{Carmo76Differential,
  author =      {do Carmo, Manfredo P.},
  title =       {Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces},
  year =        1976,

When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run
Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running
System7.1, had a 14" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a
bit faster than the LC III:

		Centris610		LCIII

CPU		13.01			6.92
Graf		15.67			7.69
Disk		2.22			2.44
Math		25.57			10.19

P.R. Rating	12.91			6.58

So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.

I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230

Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down
unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During
this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away
(For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged
configuration.

He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these
have helped. 

It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his
email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if this
problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time). 

Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the rest
unless I know that might *really* be the problem. 

He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.

Anyone who has ideas, I'd love to hear about them. I'd call Apple, but
I've found they're best to call during the week (it's Sunday evening).

Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at
least three Macs: the SE/30, IIsi and Centris 610. They have not, to
my knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could
make one, technologically.

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller
circuitry present on NuBus Macs.

Why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS
adapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS
is better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted,
there are more NuBus cards. But, most applications that require a
NuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an
LC/LCII/LCIII anyway.

Any suggestions as to what a better solution might be?  I realize the
off-hand nature of the numbers I used.  And I can't answer as to what
an acceptable loss rate is.  However,  as I said in another post,  I
despise the idea of supporting criminals for life.  It's the economics
of the situation that concern me most.  The money spent feeding, clothing,
housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are
unfit to live in society could go to a number of places,  all of which
I, and probably others,  would consider far more worthwhile and which
would enrish the lives of all Americans.  Give people jobs,  give the
homeless shelter.  Any number of things.

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm
either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.

1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)

2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center
perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
the sphere.

3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This
gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.

4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to
any of the original points.

I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)


An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting
at a point. This might be easier to implement.

May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this??  The ground is
supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest
looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for
power and protection.  It'd never meet code, and if you now own
the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities
you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...

There's a "wiring" FAQ that I think addresses this.  I believe
an alternative is use of a GFCI, but I'm really not sure what
current code allows in this area.  The GFCI senses alternate
(unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specific
protective ground wire, at least not beyond the GFCI in the
protected circuit.  GFCI breakers are available (but expensive).

Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like
this.  I of course don't know the exact situation, and
anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?


>The ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  She is quickly losing

Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus
bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this
is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up
and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with
my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but
you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've
read about it... not just from my own personal experience.


>Does anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping
>mechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs?

Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope
with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually
becomes unconscious.

The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine)
and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes
and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when
it really "kicks in").

Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either
caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and
passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as
good of care of my hearing as I should.

Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll
begin to not even notice it.  

This info is taken mostly from a few "experts", my own experience, and
some readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any
specifics handy).

As far as I know, tigers are not sentient.  If I were pushed into a pool with
some dolphins and they attacked me, I might be inclined to blame the dolphins
rather than the person doing the pushing, as (a) dolphins are not usually
aggressive and (b) they seem to have well-developed brains and a capacity for
abstract thought.

As a matter of fact, tigers rarely attack humans unless the human provokes
them.  Of course, if they are in a cage which is far too small, that might
count as provocation...

Hi.  I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra
900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem
on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be
greatly appreciated.

When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types
of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH
speakers:

system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)

Armor Alley
Spectre
Spaceward Ho!


But, the following games only play out of the left channel:

Lemmings
Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
Glider 4.0
OIDS


But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.
(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))


All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run
OOTW because he doesn't have color).

We're both running system 7.1



Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get
sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or
greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?

I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in
stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be
mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB
170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there
isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are
apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they
could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of
both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?

Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),
so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1
patch over this problem?)




Thanks for any help you can provide!

It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to 
serial port weirdness.  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX
handheld.  Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs
on two penlite batteries).  It turned out that the plus (by accident or by 
design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing 
weird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!).  The HP worked fine when 
connected to the printer port.  

Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  Have you 
tried using the printer port?

Good luck.

Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain
chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell,
(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized
example), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location
and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying
external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances
caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will
be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred
years old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few
tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the
investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some
hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding
the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.

Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein
reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as
when Volta invented the battery.  I personally don't care to revert to supernatural
cause to explain things we don't yet understand.

To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16Âµsec occur.
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back.

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

	I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence 
and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for 
each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require 
different levels of evidence.

	As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one 
may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans. 
One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The 
only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the 
individual always wear business suits, etc.

	The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the 
claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the 
level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the 
consequences of the proposition are.



	If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain 
why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between 
two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their 
distance apart. 

	Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then
we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the 
consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of 
affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, 
they are irrelevent when theorizing about the "Truth" of the law.

	Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including 
the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of 
affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find
"The Truth"?



	By the way, what is "Truth"? Please define before inserting it in 
the conversation. Please explain what "Truth" or "TRUTH" is. I do think that 
anything is ever known for certain. Even if there IS a "Truth", we could 
never possibly know if it were. I find the concept to be meaningless.

There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can
cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies
widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults
pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia)
is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae
is the most common cause.

What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis,
which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in
both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism
is also called the "meningococcus", and is the source of the
common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in
the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases),
the organism typically causes death within a day. 

This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats
of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different
ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. 

Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts
of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.

Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis
is a huge topic, and sci.med can't do it justice.

 As you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity.
However, from what I have seen, it is not often presented in this manner.
It is usually presented more in the form, "And *besides*, I cannot see...
...nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation."
 Moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such
phenomena. That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not
an argument in theism's favor. Especially when different theisms offer 
different explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly
the same theism give different explanations...

 Not im my experience. In my experience, the most common reason is the

Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to
make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values
into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was
because
of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by
scanning
this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on
some machines).

When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to
generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had
once
documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant "I
want to
play a mono sound" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted
the
documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers
of
sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you
want
to make stereo sound.

Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from
the
IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game
writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.

Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output
hardware,
and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase
works.
On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase
gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra
700/900/950
at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel
only.
Both are technically correct interpretations of the original
specification,
but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.

If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono
sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the
underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left
channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their
games will only come out the left on some games.

The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound
on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.
It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of
the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which
are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what
machine
you have.

Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:
>Lemmings
>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
>Glider 4.0
>OIDS
and also
Hellcats,
Super Tetris
Oxyd
(and many more, these are just what I've tested)

Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.


Other games you list:
>Armor Alley
>Spectre
>Spaceward Ho!
and also
PGA Tour Golf
Civilization
(and more, these are again only from personal experience)

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.

The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!
Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do,
but I'm going say it anyway.
Stop cheating on sound!
Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period
is about to end.
The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon, so use it.

In conclusion:
To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.
To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send
sound
to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of
automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all
hardware.


Have fun.

Disclaimer number 1:
I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.
So don't write me with sound questions.

Yeah - they also gave it their "Editor's Choice" in the run-down of
graphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue, which is why
I bought (and then returned) mine.  The only conclusion I can come up with
is that PC Magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness
of a video card than I do.

       Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association "Spectrum" offer
       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of
       controllers.

                     SOFTWARE

            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit
       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.
            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for
       non professional users.
            There are next possibility:
       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;
       - read - white image to - from disk;
       - print image on the printer;
       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;
       - filter image;
       - work with gistogramme;
       - edit image.
       - include users exe modules.

                     CONTROLLER VS9

       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.
       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from
       a field of 724x600 pixels.
       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in
       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This
       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal
       and vertical directions.
       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.
       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.

                     CONTROLLER VS52

       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM
       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was
       created on the base of modern elements, including user
       programmable gate arrays.
       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different
       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change
       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any
       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning
       devices).
       The controller has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;
       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64
       to 1024x512 pixels ;
       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024
       pixels;
       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.
       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024
       pixels ;
       - number of gray level - 256 ;
       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;
       - 4 input video multiplexer ;
       - input/output lookup table (LUT);
       - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";













       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external
       controlling signal) ;
       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -
       digital converter;
       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.
       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the
       controller by reprogramming it.


              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100


            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV
       signal in real time. It is possible digitize TV signal with
       512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation
       with two images.
            Processor was created on the base of modern elements
       including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board
       for PC.
            Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8
       format. It is possible to accumulate until 16 images.
            The processor has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume to 64 Mb;
       - number of the gray level - 256;
       - 4 input video multiplexer;
       - input/output lookup table;
       - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference;
       - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;
       - possibility color and black / white output;
       - possibility input from slow-scan video sources.

Well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience.  A
general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases,
by establishing links to the "Lyme community", treating patients
who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS
are probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings
of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional
patients, etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill
$100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital
and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his
office, and making lots of bread.  Also getting the adulation
of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,
then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out
by support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.

I have no experience with this particular hardware, but
just about every month in Macworld there is an add for
an combined SE accelerator/Video board.  This item sells
for about $1000 and comes with a 25MHz 68030/68882 pair,
eight SIMM slots, and a grayscale 21" monitor.

This accelerator plugs into the SE's lone expansion port
and thus no soldering.  You will however, need a long
TORX wrench to get the case open (but that's not really
a big deal).

Does that sound like what you were looking for?

	You have only shown that a vast majority ( if not all ) would

Here in Erie, PA there is a system in the inner city called Rado-Lite (a 
trade name) which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of 
way by controlling traffic lights through RADIO signals.  The receivers 
look much like what you describe, but they include a UHF whip antenna (less
than a foot tall) and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that 
an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching.  Local folklore 
says this system was invented here; I don't know if this company has any 
other installations.  It has been in operation for at least 30 years, going 
only by my memory.

I think the question is: What is extra-scientific about this?  

It has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on
where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered
legitimate hypotheses.  The point, in short, is this: hypotheses and
speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy, 
daydreams, ancient traditions, modern quackery, or anywhere else.

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works
*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means
there is at least one known bug.  Often these bugs are small and obscure;
you might never run into them in practice.

At least Motorola admits it, unlike certain other companies...

Are you arguing that the Lyme lab test is accurate?
The books that I've read say that in general the tests
have a 50-50 chance of being correct.  (The tests
result in a large number of both false positives and
false negatives.  I am in the latter case.)

We could get those same odds by "rolling the dice".

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without
doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been
known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting
smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the
person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the
interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per
day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still
rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned
about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and
even a small increase in risk is significant there.

I lived in Tokyo for a year and a half, and one of the many reasons why

feel uneasy, even if one's from an ethnic minority as I was.

is an inner city; (ii) there is a negligible level of violent crime, and
a street murder will be a lead item on *national* TV news; (iii) the

I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in 
family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.
Jory Graham published a cookbook many years ago (in cooperation with 
the American Cancer Society, I think) called "Something has to taste

The cookbook was just what we needed several times when favorite foods

Anyway, I'd like to build a UV flashlight, cheaply. "flashlight" means
it should be reasonably portable, but could have a power pack if

My main question is the bulb: where can I get UV bulbs? Do they
need a lot of power? etc., etc.

I'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave
(but hey, if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs, I'll take both).

One other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-UV
light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light. Does anyone

I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want

Hello,
I purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously 
Speedstar 24 compatible. Its name is "VGA 4000 TrueColor".
It is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE, XMODE and
at least one more MODE, as well as some drivers for Lotus, Windows, etc.
Only one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode, namely
the Windows 3.1 driver.
Nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode.
Some articles in this group about the Speedstar 24 and some other facts
made me believe that my card is compatible to that one.

Does anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted? How can I write
a driver which allows me to have 16.7 millions of colors with a resolution
of 640 x 480 with 45 Hz interlaced ?

Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from

I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips

assembly are tightened properly.  Other than that, my next guess would be one of

I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are
connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the
main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground
rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of
the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot
to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  

Hmmm.  How are those orange "isolated ground" outlets (often used in
computer rooms) wired?

of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.
I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to
comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). 
Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.

Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite
limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has
to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing
on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.

Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:

* Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future

* Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...

Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have
a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
(excellent) gear).

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is
whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode.

I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are
_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.
However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)
seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a "real" scope :-)

This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated
the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has
a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time
capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at
least they appear to be logically laid out.

One more thing about the new, "simpler", front panels. These instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our
scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these
switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments.

For better worse, the source on this on is Michael Barnsley. His article
in The Science of Fractal Images (Peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling
intro. Barnsley's book Fractals Everywhere is a more thorough treatment.
The book covers Iterated Function Systems in general, and their application
to image compression is clear from the text.

speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different
 speeds. There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but
if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy
drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. A Quadra must reboot after having its
clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its
floppy drive.

I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working
code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method
looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in 
Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.

I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor
of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either
case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution
of linear equations).

To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,
P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from P1 to P2.
These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting
center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points
(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like
I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which
will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to
find).

Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets
of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define
the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the
lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique
point if they are not parallel.

Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the 
Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:
(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes
(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 
running at 15.87 Mhz.
(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a 
lot of memory.
(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors 
that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors 
sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell 
memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most 
memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether 
the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine 
California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - 
$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that 
are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.
(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an 
average access time of about 25 ms.
(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a 
backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move 
your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or 
non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.

Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay 
for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to 
sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about 
$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for 
about $900. 

The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got 
one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright

No one else seems to know, so I'll post this.

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion
flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.
They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is
that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as
hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman
constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out
of kilter, and you get sick and die.

I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real
life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this
book, I would imagine you would have to:

1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy
   water.

2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other
   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.

During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and
eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the
poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the
water the victim ingested was heavy.

You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both
alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly
begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the
heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real
story here.

Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was
no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.

The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids
would literally be "heavy".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and
heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by
about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe
the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that
the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test
involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

Ok, this is the only thing I will comment on from Stan at this time...

quite so. Especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely.

Tommy Frandsen's VGAlib (which is probably what you're talking about)
will do the standard VGA modes, some tweaked modes and then the Tseng
ET4000 Super VGA modes. I have an ET4000 and I'm viewing GIF's at
640x480/256 (I have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on Linux. I
think I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it
use the ET4k modes.

VGAlib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA
support; each mode is an array of register values and there's a program
that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current
mode. Haven't tried it though...

(Btw, my version of VGAlib is 1.2.)

Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting:
"The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_
believer and who may be "faking it".  This is something known only by
the person him/herself (and God).  Your assumption that anyone who
_claims_ to be a "believer" _is_ a "believer" is not necessarily true."

In other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and
false Muslim. We are back to square one, Khomeini and Hussein are 
still innocent and can't be defined as evil or good Islamic 
worshippers.

Kent

The flushing is due to vascular dilation, part of a migraine attack.
Some people event get puffy and swollen.  As long as you are careful
you can see well enough to avoid getting hit in the face or eye by
the ball, migraine will not hurt your health.

Don't listen to this guy, he's just a crank.  At first, this business
about being the "one true god" was tolerated by the rest of us,
but now it has gotten completely out of hand.

Besides, it really isn't so bad when people stop believing in you.
It's much more relaxing when mortals aren't always begging you for favors.

The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little 
fat.  I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick
it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just
have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch
to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it
still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  
muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be
best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although
some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent 
irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, 
wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the
puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent
irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to
do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the 
spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,
and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 " apart.)

This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have
diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)

	Ahh no.  Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your
calculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is
307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I
don't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do
that either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and
640x480.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA.

I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line.  The main
problem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts
the system.  I hope they will fix that.  But I'm afraid, as usual,
the local doc is going to take the brunt.  People grouse about paying
$50 to see their home doctor in his office, but don't mind paying
$20,000 to have brain surgery.  They think their local doc is cheating
them but worship the feet of the neurosurgeon who saved their life.
What they don't realize is that we need more local docs and fewer

I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it.  My
needs
are much the same as what you describe.  In addition, I wanted to get one
that
I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of
inexpensive 
printers from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on
what 
font you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with 
different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
fine.

Printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed
jobs is
very easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of
the
sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet
from
the sheet feeder, as some do).

(I have no affiliation with GCC, just a satisfied customer.)

Up to 60 microamperes  =   on hook

Over something like 10 mA  = off hook

In between = defective line, and the phone company comes looking

(backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. It happens when I put 
the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just 
freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset 
switch. Other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error 
message of "Co processor not installed". 

I know one solution is NOT to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone 
have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix 
it? The memory card is Psuedostatic ram and goes into the PDS Slot. That 
probably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is King Memory (Not 
kingston) from irvine, CA. They say the problem is in my machine. 

Any Ideas? -- Gene Wright.

I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA
monitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III. 
All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work
on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the
sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very
attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I
confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an
LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your
adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a
apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an
IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can
afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!

Lucky for them that the baby didn't have any obvious deformities!  I could

Joseph say that it was God that got her pregnant and then the baby turns

If you use System 7, you can use my application Zing which has
a 30 kB footprint (meaning you can have it running all the time
without losing memory)

It is also compatible with the chat program "FishBomb" which allows
sounds and pictures as well.

Both are, as far as I know, freeware (I dustribute Zing with source)
and should be available on the normal services (mac.archive.umich.edu

Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in
emphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days
a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have
similar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more
as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions.
Of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating 
rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch...

It seems to me, that for most people, religion in America doesn't matter
that much.  You have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't
make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't.  Now, admittedly,
I have never had to suffer the "Bible Belt", but I am just north of it
and see the fringes, and the reasonable people in most things tend to be
reasonable in religion as well.

Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of
all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various
biases. 

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again, 
to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.

My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* 
you come about developing it.

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic
of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I
think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the 
business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic 
assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific
research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis
and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than 
"the old Newtonian model of the world".  And I doubt that many psychologists
would appreciate being put outside this empirical "world view".  Psychology
also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. 

>It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be

Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-
tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually 
found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will 
have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  
There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of
knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own 
discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,
even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come
to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had 
a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and 
tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting
science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a 
creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally
turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  

Again, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by "science".  I often
don't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science
is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They
portray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH
in big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,
turn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-
tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very human
process.

Yes, everyone who is normal does that.  We use candida on the other arm

we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not

Not that new.  20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB
that was resistant to everything (in Chicago).  The difference now
is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such
TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just
infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance
with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains
has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9
drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to
such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we
are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary
even if they entail force.

Possibly self-fulfilling prophecy (ie he was aware what he should do in

those keepers of the holy bible for a thousand years or so before the
general; public had access. possibly also that the text is written in such

- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that
  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?

- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee
  discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably
  cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning
  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.

- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't
  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."
  ??

- Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and
  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?

- I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.
  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),
  but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.


Thanks for any comments...

Sorry about not mentioning platform... my original post was to mac.programmer,
and then decided to post here to comp.graphics.

I'd like the 3D software to run on primarily Mac in either C, Object Pascal
(Think or MPW). But, I'll port to Windows later, so a package that runs on
Mac and has a Windows version would be ideal.

I'm looking for a package that has low upfront costs, and reasonable licensing
costs... of course :)

Subject: Re: Monitor for LCIII
Lines: 21

Jeff,
  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony
CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed
specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video
capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it
takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is
about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of
comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half
a year and I love it.  
Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a
Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons
why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only
complaint was that they did not always return my calls.  
I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's
(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.

Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL.
Version 2 did it quite well, apart from a
few hassles with radial fills. Version 3 RevB
is better but if you try to export in SCODAL
with a bitmap image included in the drawing
it will say something like "cannot export
SCODAL with bitmap"- at least it does on my
version.
 If anyone out there knows a way around this
I am all ears.
 Temporal images make a product called Filmpak
which converts Autocad plots to SCODAL, postscript
to SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs $650
and I was just wondering if there was anything out
there that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad
cheaper.

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least
that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface
Guide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes
for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired
controller.

The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC.  You'll want version 5.9 or later.  (6.0x is current.)  It allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.

Now, for a return question:  Do you run Windows?  If so, what are the dates on your drivers?  The newest ones *I* can find are from around 4-??-92!!  My problem is they conflict with Star Trek: After Dark, and other things as well.  I'm willing to bet that it's the drivers, and NOT the programs.  Anyone out there have info on newer SS24 (NOT X) drivers for windows or OS/2?

Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD-

I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools

We have recently obtained a Centris 610 and it has developed an unusual
video problem. 

Model:	610 with 8 MB/230 HD, 512K VRAM, no cards
Monitor:	Apple 16"

When the computer is set for 256 colors and certain operations are done,
particularly vertical scrolling through a window, horizontal white lines
appear on the monitor (which generally but not always spare open
windows).  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued.  If a
window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
the line disappear from that area of the screen.  This problem is not
observed if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch Apple
monitor with 256 colors is used. 

I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain.  The problem has
been apparent since day 1 but has gotten worse.

We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, and if so, how
to fix it.  Please also respond to azelenet@bigmac.mskcc.org.  Thank you

    MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old
    daughter that shocks the most.
 
    "I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what
    happened to your parents," wrote Patrick Prevost. "I loved
    your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred."
 
    Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his
    apartment in northeast Montreal.
 
    They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after
    killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.
 
    The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had
    gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money
    for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked
    his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.
 
    She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or
    lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.
 
    Five children have also been slain as a result of the same
    domestic "battles."
 
    Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their
    husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across
    Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for
    Justice. [rest of article ommited]
 
Then to say that women are somehow "better" or "should" be the
one to "stay home" and raise a child is also laughable. Women
have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often 
more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to me
it takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH should
stay home to do so!

No, this is wrong.  The purpose is to preserve the substances in
the tubes longer by creating relativistic speeds and thus
time dilatation.  Of course, by slowing the subjective time of
the test tubes they get less bored, which is probably what you

I don't know.  What is wrong?  Is it possible for humans to survive for

are a social animal, and that is a cause of our success.

No.  As noted earlier, lack of mating (such as abstinence or homosexuality)
isn't really destructive to the system.  It is a worst neutral.

That's closer, but I dislike "apps".  "software" (vs. "hardware")

No, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the
country, you don't need to be known as an LD "specialist" to see a large
number of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of
underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,
he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not
the only orthopedists in the town.

Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the
*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage
manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by
neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem
we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD
patient.

He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the
patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to
the knees).

Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.

Subject: Removing Distortion From Bitmapped Drawings?
Organization: SCTC
Lines: 47

Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a
boat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of
reference points whose true x,y positions are known.  

Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron
Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which
converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click
the mouse.

Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come
out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways
from the known true values.  This is understandable because the
scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are
successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and
contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,
scanner errors and what have you.

The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"
adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or
rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.

So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for
removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of
points 

Reference(x,y) (the known true values)

DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)

DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)

what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to
DistortedData to remove the errors.

I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted
reference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3d
surface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to remove
the errors in the other data points.

Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,
pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

Thanks,

Earl

My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom

However, when I here people assert that the only "true" freedom

that people don't even agree on the meaning of the word.

I call this notion "psychological health food" and, in fact, have

Yeah, I want to try one of those 42oz steaks (cooked over applewood) at

Texas Smoker (RIP, again) in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either.  

What say we have a rec.food.cooking dinner at the Moonlite Bar-B-Que Inn in
Owensboro? (It's all you can eat including lamb ribs & mutton for about
$10.)  We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if the
Moonlite's Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her.  (It IS too hot for me, and I
don't say that very often.)  And she could bring ice cream with crushed
dried chiltepins for dessert.  

And we could see if there IS such a thing as an "unrealistically large
quantity" of barbecue--the owner of the Moonlite estimates that the
Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the
summer, and forty thousand in the winter--in a town of 50 000 or so.  Two
pounds per person per week?   Again, sure sounds unrealistic to me--thats

Yesterday I wrote a program to do bilinear interpolation ala Numerical
Recipes, with the PBMPLUS libraries.  I'm pretty happy with the results,
but I'm looking for any already-coded non-linear interpolation schemes
before I go ahead an try to write one.  Any pointers?

First, I am not a doctor.  I know about this because I have been
through it.

It sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils).  Feel under your jaw
hinge for a swelling on each side.  If you find them, its tonsilitis.
I've had this a couple of times in the past.  The doctor prescribed a
weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up.

In my case it was associated with glandular fever, which is a viral
infection which (from my point of view) resembled flu and tonsilitis
that kept coming back for a year or so.  There is a blood test for
this.

In conclusion, see a doctor (if you have not done so already).

-*----
I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a
definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly
and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition
is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids
mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous
work.  Lee Lady writes:

Unless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a
mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would
consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as
unscientific.

Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not
clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be
taken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider,
for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking
a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and
what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what
invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and
still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,
that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that
some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are
ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the
definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are
"mainly about."

The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient
context for people to understand my proposed definition.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only
take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians
that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  

As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about
"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk
about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the
kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have
proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of
degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the
relevance of different kinds of evidence.  

One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as
psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion
regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,
the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the
historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence
are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to
speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that
speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to
identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence
was presently available for them, and to describe how research
could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to
uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper
of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the
author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It
is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --
deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When
proponents of some practice see no value in more careful
investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many
researchers' minds.  

This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some
intersection between things that are worth investigating and
things that are advocated by those who seem careless or
unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can
understand why many scientists would just as soon select other
directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one
wants to become this generation's Rhine.

I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,
dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are
submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for
publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly
eases one's defense.)

Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either
on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little
about either and so have nothing to offer.

So antihistamines can cause weight gain.  NOW they tell me. :-)
Is there any way to find out which do & which don't?  My doctor
obviously is asleep at the wheel.

The original poster mentioned fatigue.  I had that too, but it was
mostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having -- I wasn't getting

doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, how does it cause that side

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the

hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the
hundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).

I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.
Any suggestions?

Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I don't see how this argument
really leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (I'm not sure
exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity
to the Matt./Luke "Q" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost
any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from
Jesus' mouth.

The version of the "usual theory" I have heard has Matthew and Luke
independently relying on Mark and "Q".  One would think that if Luke relied
on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies,
for one thing.

This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that

Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing
copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be
written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.

I'm not really impressed with the "theology" argument.  But I'm really
pointing this out as an "if".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make
these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an
authentic letter.

The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is
not so bad.

But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it's
agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view _as I've articulated it above_ (which may not be
the true view of Khomeini) is from the basic principles of Islam. 
So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from 
the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them. And 
if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how 
subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while 
they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.

In my opinion considering any human being as having a substance

being _is_ a heretical notion and one proscribed by Islam.

Absolutely! I would be interested in discussing this privately and
I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of
error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with
the teachings of the Qur'an. However, _prima facie_ such attemptsa
are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery, explicitly
proscribed by the Qur'an.

Hi,
It might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms.
But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ).
So I'm not much interested in Amiga news. 

In the case of Software, I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this
newgroup to run on a Unix- platform, so I'm not interested in this information.

I would suggest to split the group. I don't see the problem of cross-posting.
Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size. 

BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
TRAFFIC A LOT.

Sincerely, Gerhard

Printer model and specification:

Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)
ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)


Hello,

We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. 
We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The 
copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the
printer with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print 
postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in 
turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a 
publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts 
are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of 
programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript 
with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 
rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that 
acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format
and translating the image into postscript.

We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality 
pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the 
SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a 
warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without 
some assurance that the product will work.


Here my questions:

If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or 
parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?

Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the
limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on 
the printer?
 
The Big question:

Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?



Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis. 
I will post a summary.

Thanks in advance.

I had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high
school.  Before that, I used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks,
and eyes so itchy I couldn't get to sleep.  After about 6 months on the
shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back.  I
stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college.
My allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as
bad as they used to be.  So yes, the shots do work.

This is fascinating. Atheists argue for abortion, defend homosexuality
as a means of population control, insist that the only values are
biological and condemn war and capital punishment. According to
Benedikt, if something is contardictory, it cannot exist, which in
this case means atheists I suppose.
I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an
excellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital
punishment, I'm sorry but the logic escapes me.
And why just capital punishment, what is being questioned here, the
propriety of killing or of punishment? What is the basis of the
ecomplaint?

I think it's safe to say that anything that's not at 0 degrees Kelvin
will have its own "energy signature" -- the interesting questions are
what kind of energy, and what it signifies.

I'd check places like Edmund Scientific (are they still in business?) --
or I wonder if you can find ex-Soviet Union equipment for sale somewhere
in the relcom.* hierarchy.

Some expansion on Kirlian photography:

From the credulous side: [Stanway, Andrew, _Alternative Medicine: A Guide
To Natural Therapies_, ISBN 0-14-008561-0, New York: Viking Penguin, 1986,
p211, p188.  A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32
alternative health therapies.]

  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the
  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'
  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object
  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its
  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner
  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found
  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead
  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones
  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in
  highly variable colour patterns.

  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in
  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up
  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at
  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and
  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.

  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's
  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on
  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers
  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and
  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose
  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that
  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person
  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to
  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.

  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is
  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from
  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the
  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely
  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'
  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing
  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern
  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would
  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid
  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than
  the actual object itself.

  [...]

  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer
  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...


From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, "Reality shopping; a
consumer's guide to new age hokum.", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,
vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for
evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples
of hokum.]

  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of
  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal
  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for
  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will
  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and
  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that
  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian
  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.
  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings
  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The
  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on
  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even
  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,
  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous
  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of
  the unknown.

I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to
commercially produce/sell food with carcinogenic substances, it is not illegal
for people to do such to their own food (smoking, etc).  Is this true?

Maybe, maybe not.  A new graduate would obviously be well trained (but
perhaps without sufficient experience). A radiologist trained 10 or
15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a 
whole 'nuther matter.  A OB who HAS trained in modern radiology technology
is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to 
the former.

If the radiologist is also trained in OB/GYN, why not?
