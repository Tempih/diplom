In all fairness, how many people do you know personally who read images
from Floppy drives?  I haven't tried it with JPEGs, but I do realize how
agonizingly slow it is with GIF files.  

Nevertheless, it is an important bug that needs to be squashed.  I am
merely pointing out that it was probably overlooked.  While it is serious,
one must keep in mind that it will probably affect at most 5% of the
targeted users of CView.

Frankly, I think this model is a screwup.  It does not have PostScriptlevel
2, only has 13 fonts, and does not even have  fine print or photograde, or
grayshare.  Even the 300 model has this!  I am shocked by the kind of
features you get for this printer.  I myself was hoping for some decent
printer to replace the Personal Laser Writers.

I posted this to sci.psychology on April 3, and after seeing
your post here on panice disorder thought it would be
relevant.

-----

My research indicates that two schools of thought exist.
the literature promoting medication says it's the superior
treatment.  Not surprisingly, literature promoting cognitive
therapy also claims to be superior.

What are the facts?  Early in my research I didn't have a
bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy.  I
was interested in a treatment that worked.  After reading
journals published after 1986, the cognitive therapy camp
claims a higher success rate (approx 80%), a lower drop-out
rate, and no side effects associated with medication.

Lars-Goran Ost published an excellent article titled
"Applied Relaxation: Description of a coping technique and
a review of controlled studies."  This is from Behav. Res. Ther.,
vol. 25, no. 5, pp. 397-409, 1987.  The article provides
instructions on how to perform applied relaxation (AR).
Briefly, you start with two 15 minute sessions daily, and
progress in 8-12 weeks to performing 10-15 thirty second sessions
daily.

I'll snail mail this article to anyone interested (USA only please;

For me, it is a "I believe no gods exist" and a "I don't believe gods exist".
 
In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere
with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly
conclude that when "A exist" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the
Pragmatic definition of truth, "A exists" is meaningless makes A exist
even logically false.
 
A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god
by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even
make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include
some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting
all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.

I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  I don't

Too bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients

Wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the
Middle ages. Seriously though, even the Sheiks at Al-Azhar don't
claim that the Shi'ites are heretics. Most of the accusations
and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the
Wahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of
the Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs). The teacher of
at least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq (the sixth Imam of the
Shi'ites). 

Although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around
about the Shi'ites (esp. since the revolution), there are also
many good works by Shi'ites which present the views and teachings
of their school. Why make assumptions and allegations (like
people in this group have done about Islam in general) about Shi'ites.

First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection.
Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire
shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.

The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the
tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the
grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from
each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect
the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.

  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these
electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?  What kind of
memory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough
(of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a
vehicle?  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for
this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that
are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).

Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with
a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K
actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a
new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the
buyer it has.

Thanks for any insight.

I know that there is MSG sensitivity.  When I eat foods with MSG I get
very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first
experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese
food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can
notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.

Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing
the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I
don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still
love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where
one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor
packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at
places you find MSG.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to
have a "dirty" amp.

   Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs

Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow
down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.

   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
   Good instructions are included with the chokes.
   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

And please remember to be friendly when approaching your
local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the 
cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation
and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most
are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes
dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost
pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.
interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  

BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or
not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of
being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.
Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers
to take any precautions.

Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are
required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more
than 10).  So if you hear "This is WA1QT" or some other call starting
with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.
CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required
to) and fire/police have other private ids.

timing details (0x3D4 registers 0x00-0x1F) but I don't know how to
select 36 MHz pixel clock I need. The BIOS function selects 40 MHz.

Is there anybody who knows where to obtain technical info about this.
I am also interested in any other technical information about Tseng ET4000
and Trident 8900 and 9000 chipsets.

This algorithm works well for me:

Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:
---------------------------------------------------
First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the
faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing
the two shared vertices).

Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge
dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of
this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently
orienting the entire surface.

Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point,
calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's
orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces
are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations
(mark them CLOCKWISE).

If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face
and go through the algorithm again.

At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed
before facet normals are found.

(Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the
IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to
this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.  If you're
not... sorry, I can't give out the source, and even if I could it
relies heavily on Inventor).

This is becoming a tiresome statement.  Coming from you it is 
a definition, not an assertion:

   Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a 
   believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is
   good. Blah blah blah.

That's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To
say that something produces only good because it is only good that 
it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And
all you're application is saying that it's true if you really 
believe it's true.  That's silly.

Conversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under
atheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true-
don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.  

Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and
caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no
logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for
example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering
without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of
some inaccessible god.

By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly.
For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of
terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith.
And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing
to do with it, does it?

My daughter has Epilepsy and I attend a monthly parent support group.
Just Wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throw
all the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old's
seizures.  He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported that
she did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and then
went 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate 
candy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She 
sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  With
corn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.  

With my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and stays
away from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum, won't eat
candy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won't
even use toothpaste!!!  Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk food
addict!  

Hope this helps.  Good Luck.

Gregg, I'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice
things aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim
them to be upsets you, but exactly who is being childish here is 
open to question.

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank -
what will someone bet me they weren't "real" Islamic owners and
operators? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
quite naive depositors.

And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into
BCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down
the street?   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned 
and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them? 

So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all 
work out right next time.

Yes.

I use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 
50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive.

Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.

Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.

There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in,
I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.
I don't believe there has been any great insight into the
increased incidence in that area. There is a low-level
of endemic infection in that region. Many people with
evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have
serious disease.

Sorry!! :-)

Call the four points A, B, C and D. Any three of them must be
non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface
of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either
they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).

A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC
and CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.
This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.

Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points
on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in
fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane
containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any
plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles
to the ABC one.

Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference
of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the
normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular
bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is
not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).


Algorithm:

Is the sphere well defined?
    (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure).
    (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).
    (3) Find the plane ABC and check that D does not lie in it (=> failure).
Yes. Find its centre.
    (1) Find the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.
    (2) Find their point of intersection (P).
    (3) Find the normal to the plane ABC passing through P (line N).
    (4) Find the plane containing N and D; find the point E on the
	ABC circle in this plane (if D lies on N, take E as A).
    (4) Find the perpendicular bisector of ED (line L)
    (5) Find the point of intersection of N and L (Q).
Q is the centre of the desired sphere

Numerically:

If ED << EP then Q will be very close to P (relative to the radius
of the ABC circle) and subject to error. It's best to choose D so
that the least of AD, BD and CD is larger than for any other choice.

The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs.
I've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal
bug has crept into their more recent s/w. The bug only shows up during
heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system (MacsBug can not
reboot, time to hit the restart button).

AE told me in January that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug
which I described to them. Since then they have not answered any of my
faxes asking them for a status of the bug-fix.

The QL has been great, but for now I have mine sidelined. If you are only
going to be using 2400 Baud or less, then you may have no, or very
infrequent problems,

You don't say whether or not you have any symptoms other than pain.
If you have numbness, weakness or bladder problems, for example,
these would suggest a need for surgery. If pain is your only symptom
you might do well to find a reputable, multi-disciplinary pain
clinic in your area. Chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well
with surgery, acute on chronic pain (as only symptom) doesn't fare
much better.
e correlation between MRI findings and symptoms is controversial.

Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on A&E -- some 15 years
since I saw it last.  

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film
for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances).
Clearly they "faked" a lot of the computer & robotic technology;
certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction
itself, let alone the idea of a "space germ".  

Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see
the movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'd
They Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top
lab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken
so that building will never be "cracked" so to speak by man or
nature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  And
the researchers used "spacesuits" similar to that in the film.

I'm curious what people think about this film -- short of "silly".
Is such a facility technically feasible today?  

As far as the plot, and the crystalline structure that is not Life
As We Know It, that's a whole 'nother argument for rec.arts.sf.tech
or something.

In making batteries you could use copper and zinc in an acid electrolyte.     
Copper=copper wire (pennies are now mostly zinc if I recall correctly)
zinc= zinc strip (Hardware stores arround here (Seattle) sell this to prevent
      moss buildup on the roof. An alternative would be to use a galvanized
      (zinc coated) nail
electrolyte= lemon juice -> Citric acid is the active ingrediant(sp).
 
Volta (late 18th century scientist) used a stack for his batteries-
copper disk, paper disk soaked in acid, zinc disk, copper disk, paper ....
they were advanced technology for the time.

Hi!

I don't know much about Mormons, and I want to know about serious independent
studies about the Book of Mormon.

I don't buy the 'official' story about the gold original taken to heaven,
but haven't read the Book of Mormon by myself (I have to much work learning
Biblical Hebrew), I will appreciate any comment about the results of study
in style, vocabulary, place-names, internal consistency, and so on.

For example: There is evidence for one-writer or multiple writers?
There are some mention about events, places, or historical persons later
discovered by archeologist?

Yours in Collen

You're closer than you might imagine.   I certainly despised living
under the Soviet regime when it purported to organize society according
to what they fondly imagined to be the "objective" conclusions of
Marxist dialectic.

But I don't hate Physics so long as some clown doesn't start trying
to control my life on the assumption that we are all interchangeable
atoms, rather than individual human beings.

Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.

No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is
that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of
Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and
secondary neuronal ischemia).

Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not
seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The
Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF
studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,
but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.

From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in
the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From
another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of
the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,
therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.

Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling
headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic
colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients
they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill
my office with patients holding their heads in pain.

Funny thing, the InterNet: I have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it
might be something to do with X-windows on PCs (? If you know, and have used
it, and think that it is good, email me. [ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au]).

DV/X is a common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporation's Desqview/X
software.

I have not used DV/X yet, but reading the blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me, it
sounds pretty great:
	* allows multiple DOS machines - the way that OS/2 does, but without
requiring 10 MB of RAM to get OS/2 going
	* pre-emptive multi-tasking
	* network computing - a proper X-windows client/server application -
this means that DOS program can be used on other X-windows computers on your
network, and that X-windows programs can be used on your DV/X computer
	* although it is NOT a version of Unix, it effectively has many of
Unix's features, and mostly you will be able to compile unix-type programs
using the djgpp or gnu c compilers

They advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming
magazines. They also have InterNet support online (support@qdeck.com).

Organization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire
Lines: 224



     The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and
increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still
being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER-
MONGERING "medical" establishment.
     Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in
the following article:


                          NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES
                                 A 3RD OPINION
          
               ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )


          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources 
          that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of 
          this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his 
          First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the 
          subjects of his choice. 


          ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.  
          MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food 
          Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what 
          else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )


          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST. 
               1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind 
          at a time, preferably grapes. 
               2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half 
          raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape 
          clean the intestinal linings. 
               3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice 
          you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune 
          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from 
          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to 
          your home bathroom.) 
               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and 
          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS 
          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). 
               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from 
          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and 
          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  
          Drink one glass per hour.
          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day 
          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH 
          PULP.] 
               6th day: Same as 5th day. 
               7th day: Same as 6th day. 
               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each 
          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, 
          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. 

          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. 
               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to 
          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the 
          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. 
      
          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.
               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple 
          cider "flavored" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a 
          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  
          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a 
          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal 
          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially 
          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a 
          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. 
        
          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]
               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level 
          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  
          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely 
          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt 
          (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. 
               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising 
          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your 
          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, 
          chomping your teeth together, etc.. 
               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes 
          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the 
          book "Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2", by Frances Nixon, 1973. 
               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should 
          prepare it and drain it.
          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away 
          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly 
          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt 
          other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at 
          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  
          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take 
          a 2-Billion-bacteria "Acidophilus" capsule, which is also an 
          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF "A.I.D.S." 
          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the 
          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune 
          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal 
          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for "Lyme disease".]
          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder 
          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during "Major" or 
          "Minor Periods" as listed in the "Solunar Tables" published 
          bimonthly in "Field & Stream" Magazine, (because of the 
          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields 
          present at those times).
          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. 
       
          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: 
       
               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the 
               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons 
               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for 
               about 2 months. 
        
               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to 
               perform NORMAL cell functions. 

               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  
               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  
               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per 
               day.
               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  
               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer 
               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile 
               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is 
               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] 

               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include 
               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most 
               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A 
               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide 
               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up 
               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-
               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime 
               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), 
               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, 
               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not 
               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST 
               "A.I.D.S.", which is really a form of cancer similar to 
               leukemia.]  (See the book "Life Extension", by Durk 
               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) 

               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% 
               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably 
               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, 
               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  
               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers 
               several times per day.
               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good 
               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants 
               described above. 

               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and 
               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA 
               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. 

               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) 
               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on 
               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an 
               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-
               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with 
               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH 
               magnetic fields. 

               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES 
               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well 
               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics 
               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos 
               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! 

               INTERFERON tablets.

               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). 
           
               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical 
               problems (even drug addiction!). 

               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure 
               prostate trouble. 

               This list is NOT exhaustive. 


          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-
          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent 
          and cure many other medical problems including heart-
          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work 
          effectively. 

          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these 
          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send 
          a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it 
          to CURE the cancer. 

          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, 
          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies 
          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), 
          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations 
          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer 
          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

My test movie was created at 320*240 resolution, it wasn't being scaled up.
Scaling was a very CPU-intensive operation with the original QuickTime (1.0);
the current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -> 320*240),
but even so, I'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as
with playing back an actual 320*240 movie. I haven't done any numerical
measurements for scaled playback.

Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact
social morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient
religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single
denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute
and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have 
this incredible talent of creative thinking.

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.

(Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive...)

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there
is no problem building an expansion box.

The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface
with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work
together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:
here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with
this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You
may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2
video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra 
electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so
guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?

So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.

  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the
10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.

  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially
double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.
The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used
previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham
Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.

  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used
at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design
of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).

  While using this would have let me reduce the "external" IF count on
receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I
didn't bother with it.

  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2
MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios
actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and
speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data
stream is another matter entirely.

  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a
"beacon" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow
due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO
also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even
though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes
of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of
a second.

  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in
and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland
IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the
proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running
low on resources of time, money and energy.

  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW
ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma
Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally
polarized.

  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly
approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and
you might want to carefully consider your "target".  If you can't
arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think
you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by
multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.
For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread
spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.
I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.

I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac, at startup, what kind of
monitor is connected.  Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac
magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a
video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions
on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).

If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and
forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the
Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software
intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable
setting and switch automatically?

Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by 
today's standards.  If you have an idea about its voltage and current 
ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with 
anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating 
of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely "ON" 
at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or 
less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is 
used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to 
experiment with various gain-altering techniques.

Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.

I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.
I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as
primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem
to exhibit self-awareness.

It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve
as an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc.  In
a pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5.

If they could couple that thought with RocketShare, and let you use both the
'030 on the PB and the '040 on the dock, it would be a mighty powerful dock.

	Uh oh...
	Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  Some involve
modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new
ways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact
is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or
less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not
impossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,
assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,
legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy
protected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications, and are merely curious?
	Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I
can.

	Incidentally, the "Uh oh..." at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  
trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  
and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  
to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  
place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  
that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  
wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  
could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   
It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  
wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  
correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  
my NeXT that way.

Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  
problem, and at pretty high speeds too.

I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  
pretty standard.

Hope this helps,

It probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is

Dyer is beyond rude. 

There have been and always will be people who are blinded by their own 
knowledge and unopen to anything that isn't already established. Given what 
the medical community doesn't know, I'm surprised that he has this outlook.

For the record, I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several 
past few years, with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional 
deficiencies. I had not taken any antobiotics. 

My dentist (who sees a fair amount of thrush) recommended acidophilous:

After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis, the outbreaks ceased.
When I quit taking the acidophilous, the outbreaks periodically resumed. 
I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then.

Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...

The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a 
modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was.
Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would 
die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People 
gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing 
how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe 
he did make the sun stand still.  
Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn 
to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example 
anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see 
this right away.
Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the 
real thing.

Sorry about the misinformation.  I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900, see previous
post.  About sampling the CD audio though, have you tried it?  I 
found the aliasing to be really bad.  Like it needed a filter or something.
Much worse than I expected.  I installed the CD-300 in the 
Quadra myself so maybe I missed something.  Everything else
works great though.

Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland
fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc. 
I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which
converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and
Polyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc).
The program has a lot nice features.
So if interested give me a mail.

	Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part
because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure
of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just
exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products
is that this matches a hardware optimization.

	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has
TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)
so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can 
be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.
ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND
gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and
inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).

	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT
gates (with your choice of internal connections between the
various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum
of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into 
a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization
of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to
do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist
with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of
a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software
does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding
it all out, then simplifying.

Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it
in the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point
me in the right place to look...

We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole
passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis:

                                                          |
                                     ||                   [ image
                                                          |
  X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen
                            metallic || tube              |
                                     ||                   |
                                                          |

We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However,
the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the
object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not
parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely
that the object is placed so conveniently.  

Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot
know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that
they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?

Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar
(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the
screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?

So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the
image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how
do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.

Thanks in advance, Simon.

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are "blind" in various ways.  Some of these
are:

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
     control group or the test group.

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis
is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it.  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
the control and test groups are treated alike.

The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector 
are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the
cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB
port. If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre, that
means a new motherboard (though a component replace IS
physically possible)

Same goes for serial ports (LocalTalk as well)

All five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the
death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent,
and aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise
I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief.
The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience. Public
or private disavowal of Islam or conversion to another faith is not
punishable (there are some jurists who have gone against this
trend and insisted that apostasy is punishable (even by death) - but
historically they are the exception.

Cursing and Insulting the Prophets falls under the category of "Shatim".

Re: RMS readings

Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS
and but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring
average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves
(i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most)
any waveform, you need a "True-RMS" DVM/DMM which literally does the
Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.

I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities
quite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000
feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...

Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very
dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep
away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.

Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there
(no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible?
Is there something else that I could do?

A long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about
altitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messages?

Many thanks,

I propose "We have no motto."

Recently in the glorious state of Maryland (the only state whose state song
refers to Abraham Lincoln as a tyrant), people have gotten all wound up over
the state motto (which we inherited from the Calverts):

    "Fatti Maschii, Parole Femine"

which, if you read Italian, says,

    "Manly deeds, womanly words"

or something to that effect.  In the state which not so long ago had four
women out of seven representatives, this represents a problem.  The official
solution was to change the translation, so now it means:

    "Strong deeds, gentle words"

My personal suggestion was changing it to "walk softly and carry a big
stick."

The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the 
best explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself 
out (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by 
1/4, then 1/8 etc.

As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct 
length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the 
wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR 
in using the middle channel of those you are going to use.
Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, 
nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not 
much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it 
anyway.

You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical
that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies
along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.  If
it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you
may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals.
Better be same than sorry.  Obviously, drinking the river without
processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites.

Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog
multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run
from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic
inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.

This is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity
amplifier:

                 +-----/\/\/\-------+
                 |                  |
                 |    /--------\    |
INPUT -+-/\/\/\--+----| -      |    |
       |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT
       +-/\/\/\--+----| +      |
                 |    \--------/
                 |
CONTROL	---------X (analog switch)
                 |
                 |
                ---
                GND

All resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed,
the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is
non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim
out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show
up as carrier feed-through).

For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems,
especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't).

There usually is a way, however, often, telephone companies like to
keep all of their internal numbers private. Depends on your exchange.
Any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth
lines that echo the number you called from. The line service guys use this
to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines.

Occam's Razor is not a law of nature, it is way of analyzing an
argument, even so, it interesting how often it's cited here and to
what end. 
It seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being
primitive, simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and
childish, and yet again condemned as being too complex (Occam's
razor), the scientific explanation of things being much more
straightforeward and, apparently, simpler. Which is it to be - which
is the "non-essential", and how do you know?
Considering that even scientists don't fully comprehend science due to
its complexity and diversity. Maybe William of Occam has performed a
lobotomy, kept the frontal lobe and thrown everything else away ...

This is all very confusing, I'm sure one of you will straighten me out
tough.

Sounds about right.

If there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to
aggresively cut prices.  Once the demand fall off a bit, then is the
time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long can
really hurt your business though :-)

The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing
down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the
only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100,
the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).  I'd bet they'll
be coming out with more power versions too.

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark

Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup 
several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve your
sight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett, 
('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It 
talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been
any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by 
actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing 
the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the 
too-long eyeball?

Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most
logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,
i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been
any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by 
changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of 
eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the 
eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's 
idea, right?)

Thanks for any information.

What I've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior.
That is, it doesn't take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to
be immoral (in some cases).  Also, I've said that morality is a remnant
of evolution.  Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in
the animal kingdom.

But, this doesn't get us anywhere.  Your particular beliefs are irrelevant

go and open the PowerBook control panel(7.1).  There is a setting

Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have
which is 3.5" 600RPM!!

I now have some information on how to modify this for use with a BBC B 
computer. Not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm
(tried that) but also change 8 components in the Rec/Play section to allow
for the lower data rate (250kbit, not 500kbit as it was designed for) and also
change the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate/rev speed!

Hopefully this should sort it all out .... not bad for 9 quid (normally 32 
quid and upwards ....)

The drive is a JVC MDP series drive ...

   Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the

A couple of folks have suggested the "corn connection".  In the five month
period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  I checked
the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  She has also never had a problem
eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day
with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  I do believe that
Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops.  But
the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
wonder.

Thanks for checking into this.  All information at this point is valuable to me.

My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the
much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a 1kHz
tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your
input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was
what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays
they're easy, and the results are better.

As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question "WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?" I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she 
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  
(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the 
food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
forming) ?

This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my
children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in 
pet food?

Perpetual machines cannot exist. I thought that there

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which

in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.
So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.

For power:

  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )

For amplitude

  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )

'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation
convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.

Common references for audio are:

	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV = 1 volt

	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)
	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)


Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.

Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

I've even seen pictures of an installation where the ham pulled a little 
trailer behind his car with a 4KW generator, and ran the full legal limit 
while mobile. I don't know what his gas mileage was like, though, or 
where he found resonators able to stand the gaff.

But of course YOUR version of YOUR position has been included in the

only last week you claimed that you "might not" answer the Challenges

Hi all,

I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd
like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to
use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation
consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.

We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,
and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control
circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.

I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the
cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one
problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be
a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,
so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid
cuetape!)

Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.
(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)
This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.
What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay
for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay
is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit
of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured
out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!


Thanks,

Mark Fontana

No.  It wouldn't be sufficient cause to bitch to the system operator if this
was just some guy saying that atheists are going to hell.  The point was 
that recently many messages were posted from that address.  Each of these
messages was posted to a different newsgroup, with the apparent intent of
provoking the readers of that particular group.  This, along with the fact
that these posts were written in all-caps, makes these posts suspect.
Whoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly.  If it is the
intended user, they should consider appropriate action.  If it is someone
else-- which seems a possibility, then this is also reason to report it.
	We get many posts in the flavor of the one that started this thread.

What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?

March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about
dimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-
control as the best method for controlling brightness.
  I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing
filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had
heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by
cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's
power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then
nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has
tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. Any
advice is appreciated!

Off the top of my head, I might try:

Given: p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4

Find:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_1, ..., p_4), 
       dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)

p_c is the same distance from our four points, so
dist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4) 

Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:
distsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4) 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the 
x^2_c, y^2_c, and z^2_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three 
linearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).  
Solve using your favorite method.  :)


All the best,

- John :)

How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular 
Motorola microcontrollers.  I am a novice at microcontrollers, but I am
starting to get into them for some of my projects.  I have several 256k
SIMMs laying around from upgraded Macs and if I could use them as "free"

to store several hundered CID records etc...

Nope.  I'm pretty sure that this person knows how to take the ball out.
I think that what they want to do is take the mouse apart.  The old mouse

The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:

"A gram of this dye costs a dollar.
It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.
And if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar."

I.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
it to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct
that cost almost nothing intrinsically.

I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of
mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot
of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years
(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from
painful experience:

  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.
     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more
     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.

  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear
     that these things will itch for months.

  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of
     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,
     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could
     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special
     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is
     required to get it.

  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old
     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall
     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers
     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I
     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some
     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.

  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.
     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally
     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is
     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of
     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was
     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In
     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get
     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we
     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They
     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur
     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)

  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget
     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment
     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone
     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine
     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.
     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this
     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think
     it gains nothing).

  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved
     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery
     as well.

Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban
doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors
seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I
suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers
would make a *lot* of money.

Subject: updated keyboard question for the plus
Organization: Illinois State University
Lines: 44

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.
It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with
a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you
very much).
 
well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .
 
one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the
newer models are different from the connection used on the plus---
you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus
and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in
other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.
it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.
 
omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution
so others can, too. thanx for the input.

	We only need to ask the question: what did the founding fathers 
consider cruel and unusual punishment?

	Hanging? Hanging there slowing being strangled would be very 
painful, both physically and psychologicall, I imagine.

	Firing squad ? [ note: not a clean way to die back in those 
days ], etc. 

	All would be considered cruel under your definition.
	All were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers.

Well, I also have an LC III.  Popping the top revealed:

	One "socket" for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One "socket" for a 72-pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flat-pack FPU

	A processor-direct slot (PDS) identical to the LC/LC II, but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side (for the full 32-bit

That's it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
in the PDS, but that's the only place.

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or
some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them
did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's
nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:
psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental
toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of
these.

There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try
different things, some of which seem to help.

Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.
Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.

Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)
diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good
doc.

I don't know where Douglas Adams took it from, but I'm pretty sure he's

I'm no expert at UPS's, but you said something that made it sound like
you didn't realize something.  On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),
there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is
ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - 
the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but 
there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it 
takes a while).

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,
why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw
things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when
you "need" it.

Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at least
SOME of this helped.

First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,
transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla
coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean
an "air core resonant transformer". The TV flyback version Tesla
coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for
diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called
"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly
efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,
which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve
efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core
resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI
for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil
from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all
Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter
and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind
to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,
gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and
telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????

GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE
TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!

If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.
(flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).

Is that true?  I know some that won't even interview FMGs.  
Most programs discriminate, in that given an FMG equally
qualified as an American they will take the American.  What
rights do they actually have?  Does it matter if they are
US citizens (most are not)?  We have had good luck with FMGs
and bad luck.  SOme of our very best residents have been FMGs.
Also, our very worst.  As it turns out, the worst FMGs are often
US citizens that studied in off-shore medical schools.  Of the
5 residents fired for incompetence in the 12 years I've been here 
in my department, all have been FMGs.  3 were US citizens who studied 
in Guadalajara, 1 was a US citizen but was trained in the Soviet Union, 
and one was Philipina.  Unfortunately, all are now practicing medicine
somewhere, 3 of them in Neurology after having been picked up by 
other programs, 1 in psychiatry, and the other in emergency medicine.

 I refer you to the bonobos, a species of primate as closeley related to
humans as chimpanzees (that is, very closely). They have sex all the
time, homosexual as well as heterosexual. When the group finds food, they
have sex. Before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. After they
escape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. Sex serves a very important
social function above and beyond reproduction in this species. A species
closely related to humans. There is some indication that sex performs
a social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that
such a function is not *impossible*.

I don't feel that I'm preaching. I'm just trying to answer people's 
questions and talking about my religion, my beliefs.
When it comes to what I post, I don't do it with the intent of converting 
anyone.  I don't expect for the atheists in this newsgroup to take what I 
say with a grain of salt if they so wish.
I just state what I beleve, they ask me how I believeit and why and we all 
go on. 
If that's preaching, then I'm soory and I'll get off the soapbox.

Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects
for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer
graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each
frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics
would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames
per second).

It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.
True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual
databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This
is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of
the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion
of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system
must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
data representations.

Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15
frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps
due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the
graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant
frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general
does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the
UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time
operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. 
Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time
operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not
even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our
multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due
to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.

From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments
requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time
multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems
on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2
systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly
important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.

You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are
off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,
being targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most
popular are (in no particular order):

	- Division Inc.		    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS
	- Sens8 Inc.		    (Sausalito, CA)    - WorldToolKit
	- Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA)     - NPSnet (FREE!)

	- Paradigm Simulation Inc.  (Dallas, TX)       - VisionWorks, AudioWorks

There are some others, but not off the top of my head...

The PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the 140.
The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one.  I don't

Are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it?
Anyway, I think that "revenge" or "fairness" is why most people are in
favor of the punishment.  If a murderer is going to be punished, people
that think that he should "get what he deserves."  Most people wouldn't
think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.

Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the
minority.

Where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?  If
someone wrongs me, I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him.  If someone kills
another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.
Is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?

Or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should
never be violated?  This would sound like some sort of religious view.

Once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.

And, you still have not answered my question.  If you are concerned about
the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent,
then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment.  Shouldn't we,
by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid
violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?

Well, I could use the argument that some here use about "nature" and claim
that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman
powers are beyond what a human has, and since you are a human, any powers
you have are not beyond those of a human.  Hence, you cannot have superhuman
powers.  Sound good to you?

Anyway, to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group,
since you are posting from a american college site, I'm willing to take it
as given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And, assuming there is some
coherency in your position, I will take it as a given that you do not have
superhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves, in some respects.

"Extra" evidence?  Why don't we start with evidence at all?

I cannot see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would
ever accept.  As for the second, it is the foundation of the religion.
Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus (back in the 40 day period)
is a believer, and therefore is discounted by those in this group; since
these are all ancients anyway, one again to choose to dismiss the whole
thing.  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else--
even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means*, so
again I don't see how evidence is possible.

I thus interpret the "extraordinary claims" claim as a statement that the
speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter.

If you are going to use one where it counts (eg:aviation, space scuttle,

for every other use you can buy a cheapie. I have a metex which is some 
made up name, as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it, I 
bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see 
that it's definetly a cheapie.) So far it has proved to be accurate, taken 
moderate abuse, and has many features on it (CAP, FREQ,Transistor check, 
etc). I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name. Hope this helps.

Summary: Need help!!!

One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...

For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply
to the following specs:

Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V
Current:   *limited* at 1A

Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A
AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)

Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting
regulator chip ;^)

Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to
do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do,
if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the
supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we
should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm 
resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by
necessity, must be 1V.

The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output 
power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.

So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?

Thanks in advance.

    I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the

an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.

    Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with
an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this
configuration then you are getting an FPU.

>>Why say "optional" if it's built in?

    Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.

    This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed
to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the
buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.

    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs
of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full
040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.

    They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated
countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware
designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that
the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.

    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles
on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....

    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  Not because the engineers at BMW are
putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile
environment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.

   If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,
it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):

         * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )
         * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:
                                This is a car, not an electron.
         *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be
                                        electrical noise or contact bounce

    As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of
a BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the
middle of the card.  Good luck getting at the counter :-).

    I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's
probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  After all,
a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an
app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this
in good detail.

To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So
there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a
given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely
and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums
of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other
hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which
eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies
contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people call
THIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both
these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  

Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor
appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is 
ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  


My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make
extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using
methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this
is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach
their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.

Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before
the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is
famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later 
mathematicians did prove them, of course.)  

I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not
so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a 
matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of 
incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to 
objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an
essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step 
of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward 
that goal then one is not doing science.)

When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and
seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also
worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further
investigation.  

In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: 
> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that
> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  

Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable
amount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as I
suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately 
specific question to try and answer.  

The "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science 
currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  
I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use 
of "reason and observation."

One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether
in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced
practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  

Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with
the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there 
is any existing research related to this question.

My wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.  When
the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used
the ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was)

On her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if
they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
read the pictures.  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they
were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT!

My wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months
back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.

Should my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a 
radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find
such an expert in Chicago?)  We don't really have any special medical
reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the ob-gyn can't, then I don't see why we shouldn't use one.

Any thoughts?

That's because these "peer-reviewed" studies are not addressing
the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models.
You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument
with a statement like "noting that animal administration has pro-
duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its
use in humans."  This is precisely NOT what you said.

It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of
glutamate involve more than "food science".

So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with
the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to
Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.

>The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids.

Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a
essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy
without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
in the blood.

Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of
glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this "projected safety
margin" is a construct derived from animal models and given that,
you can "prove" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in

You mean "asserting".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just
plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily
have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential
for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything
whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any
studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious
reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon
of the "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".  It says nothing about the frequent
inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.

I PLAN ON CHANGING HEADERS SOON, SO BE CAREFUL! ONLY THE "Resource Listing"
keys are sure to remain in the Subject: line!

0. Places to find the Resource Listing
6.  3D graphics editors

This is mainly a guide for computer graphics software.
I would suggest reading the Comp. Graphics FAQ for image analysis stuff.

It's entitled: 
 (date) comp.graphics Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

 John T. Grieggs <grieggs@jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov> is the poster of the
 official comp.graphics FAQ

I have included my comments within braces '[' and ']'.

#This file is crossposted to comp.graphics, comp.answers and news.answers,
so if you can't locate it in comp.graphics, you're advised to search in
#comp.answers or news.answers
(The latter groups usually are archived in your site. Contact your sysadmin
for more info).

These 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in
many places (see below)

--

Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site
pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory
pub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears
in the Archive-name line at the top of the article.
This FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]

There's a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to
mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field

--

The inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the
Subject 4: Mail servers )

--

The Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine
enuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list.
It's got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of
indexing.

--

Another place that monitors the Listing is the MaasInfo files.
For more info contact Robert E. Maas <rem@btr.com>

--

Yet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH
(Swiss Academic and Research Network) system in Switzerland:

interactive:
  telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as "info". Move to the
  info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory. Search in the
  00index file by typing "/" and the word to look for.
  You may then just read the FAQ in the "faqs" directory, or decide
  to fetch it by one of the following methods.

ftp:
  login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and
  enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a
  password.

	cd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings

mail:
  send e-mail to

RFC-822:
   archive-server@nic.switch.ch
X.400:
  /S=archive-server/OU=nic/O=switch/PRMD=switch/ADMD=arcom/C=ch/

Enter 'help' in the bodypart to receive instructions. No information
is required in the subject header line.


1. ARCHIE
=========

The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for
requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie
before asking help in the newsgroups.

Archie servers:
  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)
  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)
  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)
  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)
  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)
  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)
  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)
  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)
  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])
  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])
  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])
  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])
  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type "archie" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject "help" to "archie" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify "archie" as the host name and "archie" as
the username.)

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying "I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?"  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called "The Graphics BBS".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

BBSes
-----
  There are many BBSes that store datafiles, etc.etc., but a guide to these
  is beyond the scope of this Listing (and the resources of the author!)
  If you can point to me Internet- or mail- accessible BBSes that carry
  interesting stuff, send me info!

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a "Subject:" line containing only the word
  "help" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I
ask this again:

1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be
   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?

2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents?

3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,
   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).

NOTES:

   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter.
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents *if* they exist.
   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.

Thanx,
Eric.

I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the
price of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek
reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess
is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price
structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.

Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for
mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new
machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my
IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me
to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel
betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next
week (heh).

Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait
until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and
then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but
you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the
computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous
state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them
again (grin).

Not any more so than

      holding people against their will is wrong
      if you hold people against their will we will punish you
      our punishment will be to hold you against your will

Is there any punishment which isn't something which, if done by a private
person to another private person for no apparent reason, would lead to
punishment?  (Fines, I suppose.)

  Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:

  25 MHz 68040
  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower
      than Q 950 style machines for sure).
  Ethertalk card on-board
  Audio in/out
  4 MB RAM on motherboard
  4 SIMM slots
  2 NuBus slots.
  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.

In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.
  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more.

The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current
feeling
is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that
patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation
of
intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small
amounts
of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.  
Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.

The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions.
Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are
avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the
fudge, though ;-)  .

Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and
informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what
causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but
if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are 
tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's
commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with
severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.

There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed
the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading
to anyone with an interest in Crohn's.

And, as I always say when dealing with Crohn's, as does Spencer, Good Luck!

My Datadesk Mac 101E keyboard has similar problems. I have found that
holding down the RIGHT-HAND shift key at startup will work (disable

Hello Mr. Au,

I have to disagree regarding your assessment of Macintosh in Hong Kong. The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin


e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.

Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.

Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.

I have the same problem and was about to post this....

Hello duo owners (and Apple technical people :-)
 
I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from
sleep when running on battery power. When woken (usually for the second
time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a
corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be
recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of
the machine. The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard
(no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1
etc). I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC.
I've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).
 
What's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or
hardware ? 
 
If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and
waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same
behaviour (and let Apple know too !).
 
Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.
 
Bruce

Hello--

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that
it proudly proclaims "8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING" on the box.  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete "samples"
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),
I don't understand this "8 TIMES" business...  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs
said "4 TIMES" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting
senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't
I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording
process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate
(from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data
rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean
that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has 
changed since 1983?

I'm so confused...

The weathers great, the people are great and our Electronic Engineering department is great.
I am a first year student here ... so I don't know much about what projects but I do know they have a good reputation in the fields of dsp and communications.  Ever heard of QPSX?  The people who own are ex-UWA ... so that gives an indication of what the department is like.

I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my
cpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35.
On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor
to the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my
cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor
of 47k.

It functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses
that occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the
rise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should
be able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.
This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu
and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not
doing anything high-speed.

In the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the
phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
speed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate the
resistor value?

Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists
for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That

Here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything
or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not
telling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments
against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an
alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably
call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize
of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,
and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you
are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.

I'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised it
so well I can't see what. Where did I mention ideals, out-dated or
otherwise? Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything
at all to contribute?

Gee, I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common
use in WWII, so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops
landing on a beach, for example.

Which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid-60s.  At a communications
conference a Marine Corps communications officer said he didn't care
much for all the spread-spectrum multi-access expensive communication
systems that people were talking about at the time; what he wanted
was a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a $4.95 Japanese
transistor radio stuck in the ear of every Marine hitting the beach.

Subject: Immunotherapy for Recurrent Miscarriage
Organization: worldbank.org
Lines: 17


     Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of
my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind
of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as
it normally would a "foreign" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the
body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells
apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she
successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active
9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.
     We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including
the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know
whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive
pregnancies.
     Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?
Thanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake)

If Apple didn't put out such a good product -- I'd gladly take my
business to -- to -- the 8-bit Ataris.  I think the
situation with the Express modem is inexusable for any business.
I've had mine on order since January.  Apple finally called me last
week -- to tell me that I should have it "by the second week of May."
In the meantime, I've been stuck with my Duo210 without the
connectability I needed it for.  I'm sure there are plenty of people
who can bite back at me, citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is
right or at least justified, but I'm just a crabby consumer and
when I order a "Duo210 with modem" that's the product I expect.

Oh, well.  It's not like it's limited to the computer biz.  Remember
when the Miata came out?  What about those Cabbage Patch Dolls?  Well,
I want my toy!  ;)

Close. My mother comes from Gainesville Tex, right across the border.

One should be aware that foreign doctors admitted for training
are ineligible to apply for resident alien status.  In order
to get the green card they have to return to their country and
apply at the embassy there.  Of course, many somehow get around
this problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town
with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks
a rider onto a bill saying "Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent
residency in the US."  A lot of bills in congress have such riders
attached to them.  Marrying a US citizen is the most common, although
now they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell US
citizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines, or
whereever.

Might be a good idea...  The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV
In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than
that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect
inside a PC.

Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low
distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital
Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized
waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on
the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.
(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed
- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)

If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at
the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete
sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it
uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated
from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design
guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db
max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces

A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a
call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000
for application assistance.

This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.
(Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)

>I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC-

I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out
of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be
throwing out your money.

Sorry, I don't know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing,

I enjoy reading c.g very much, but I often find it difficult to sort out what
I'm interested in. Everything from screen-drivers, graphics cards, graphics
programming and graphics programs are discused here. What I'd like is a

What do you other think.

It's got potential.  Instead of *.chemistry, how about splitting the
classification into *.biochemistry (which are probably the topics
you're thinking of) and *.pharmaceutical (which otherwise might end up
in *.(bio)chemistry)?

(This is separate from the issue of whether there is sufficient potential

OK, just for grins:
- Kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene
ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail.
- Archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in
his bath.

In neither case was there "no connection to prior theories, concepts, etc."
as you stipulated above. What there was was an intuitive leap beyond
the current way of thinking, to develop ideas which subsequently proved
to have predictive power (e.g., they stood the test of experimental
verification).

I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the "Yeast Connection"
that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.  Of course, they are
working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus
membrane tissue with associated "mild" inflammatory response can and does
occur in a large number of people.  If you reject this "yeast hypothesis",
then I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic
endeavor.  Stay tuned.

	But, this just shows then that painful execution is not considered 
"cruel" and unusual punishment. This shows that "cruel" as used in the 
constitution does NOT refer to whether or not the punishment causes physical 
pain.
	Rather, it must be a different meaning.

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study (search for "life
events" in any recent version of Adiposity 101).

The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have
lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused
the weight gain in the first place.  This is critical because
someone who gains weight because of something temporary (drug
effect, life event, etc.) may appear successful at dieting when
the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary
condition that caused the weight gain.

Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based
Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and
the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,
NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.

Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except
perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC
slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC
accelerators.

One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will
need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with
Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.

Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs
will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC
and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in
existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking
prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen
much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.

First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed
CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.
This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled
for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which
I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do
this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as
standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where
Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup
is in order.

By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,
Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor
front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.
Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all
the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent
right now.

Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market
position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially
if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it
might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome
battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not
guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of
several.

I've had a couple of e-mail responses from people who seem to believe that
this sort of thing is not only unsupported, it is downright dangerous.

I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple. Just to be sure, I
asked a couple of our technicians, one of whom has been servicing Macs for

ADB devices with the power on.

What do you mean by "police band" - there is no such thing.

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
openers in malls would be illegal.

One of the great problems here is that there are too many
ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
be laws refereing to "police bands", they are almost certainly
local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,
but incompetent idiots.

Unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable).
Lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until
the day where you are faced with death for not doing X, and
amputation of all your limbs for doing X ... the choice will be yours.

Size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a
percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries
too, are all measures of size.  In this case I'd say the relevant
statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to
total casualties from among the total civilian population in the
affected geographical area.

Western news in general, but in particular the American "mass media":
CBS, NBC, ABC, etc.  The general tone of the news during the whole
war was one of "those poor, poor Iraqis" along with "look how precisely
this cruise missile blew this building to bits".

Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy
to say from our "enlightened" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back
then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.
After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of 
thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and 
millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and 
other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All 
things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were
essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick
end to avoid even greater allied losses.

I, for one, don't regret it.

I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the
West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,
misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and 
threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's
oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been
prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West
before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is
responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a
strong response from the West was required.

Well, it's not very "loving" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up
nearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass
slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I'd have to
say yes, stopping Hussein was the most "loving" thing to do for the
most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.

I mentioned it.

If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would
have been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned
in WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take
Austria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting
Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to
protect Saudi Arabia.

So?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American

I have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution

OK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.
And frankly, the original "not guilty" verdict baffled me too.  But then
I learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict
on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably
would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated
assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which
news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California
law.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that 
the first jury decided that the officers were "not guilty".  Note, 
not "not guilty" of doing wrong, but "not guilty" of aggravated assault 
with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the 
prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a 
verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.

If the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then
I feel the "not guilty" verdict was a reasonable one.

I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.

The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and
better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,
and (2) that DEC did.

On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer
companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market
position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they
have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the
system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in
computer lifetimes) relatively old.

On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far
superior than the industry "average", and that, in my opinion, SGI's
history is better than DEC's.

(And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they
going to "abandon" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade
path to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)

Anyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things

and everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative

opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.

Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as
an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how
would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all

Tammy, is this all explicitly stated in the bible, or do you assume

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least
a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short
description of the process which we use; if you have further questions,
feel free to poke me via e-mail.

================================================================
*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion

0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This
   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are
   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.
   Consider deleting these edges.

1) Now, there are two goals:

    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)
    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)
       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured 
       using the digitized (x,y)'s).

2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For
   example:

    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you
       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will
       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the
       Reference(x,y). 
    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.
       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge
       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). 
       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the
       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the
       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.

3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).

alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider
how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist
on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to
balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length
of the edges.

WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be
observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and
you can't allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of
these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of
individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using 
the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the
original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was
prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and
change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I
*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more
compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having
every point interact with every other point....but first read up on
linear solutions to the n-body problem.

There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on
springs, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.  The
above method is described, in more or less detail in:

    Nope. The Apple 16" monitor does not support multiple resolutions.
It is not a multi-synching monitor.

Here in switzerland, the situation is exactly the same. The cable tv companies  
even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable  
tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency  
conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running  
into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look  
for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or  
the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far  
bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an  
administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they  
get...
The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their  
rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get  
out of our freqencies.

Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and
re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.  Not only will flawless
cosmetic surgery be possible, but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY.

What will it be like to store all the prices of shelf-priced bar-coded
goods in your head, and catch all the errors they make in the store's
favor at SAFEWAY?  What will it be like to mentally edit and spell-
check your responses to the questions posed by a phone caller selling
VACATION TIME-SHARE OPTIONS?

Indeed, we are today a nation at risk!  The threat is not from bad genes,
but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes
which are the units of genetics.

We stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful
memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will
run rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that
future technology has to offer.

For example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions
against the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at
CALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid
Mary.

We must expand the public-health laws to include quarantine of people
with harmful memes.  They should not be allowed to infect other people
with their memes against genetically-engineered food, electromagnetic
fields, and the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you
asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would
probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at
least some were able to tolerate it.

You see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general

Well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity
of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for
people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems
for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking
clinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.

Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However,
I think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted
with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).

Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the
motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed
in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say,
but I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively
despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.

Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think
that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people
(just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their
faiths.

So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?

Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto
somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.

That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of
the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included
all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes
(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.
They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not
mentioned.

So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly.
I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.

>[...]  Based on this idea I doubt that any additional expense would

I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency.

Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it
should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences.

Then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.

Why not?  It is the majority that put it there.

But do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  Do they remember
that some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  Why don't
you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?

[...]

What?  Should I ask some scientists the probability that something Einstein

You need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think

No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court

Assuming 68HC11...
In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM
controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you
could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh
address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd
timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.

Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which
has a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one
of those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664
DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only
another component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256
DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).

It *can* be done, just takes a bit of logic design. I'm actually
about to do it using a 65C02P3 chip... I've got 8 256k simms... that's
2 megabytes on my Apple //e... (used to be in my '386).

If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with
a 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support.  My 
understanding is that the "optional fpu" refers to your option of purchasing
the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU.

Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU
system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system
(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.
Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY
comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU -
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

Hope that helps.

GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian
without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).
Oops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community,
better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)

Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians
will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,
just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general
population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among
physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -
any help here a.p.p.er's?)

One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious
choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to
control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are
also extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This trait
is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to
lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,
to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and
technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-
minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types
and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,
when the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of this
personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.

A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their
temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),
and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient
must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've
known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them
with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they
usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an
extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).

Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)

Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.

You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have
been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being
the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people
myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion
above the level of anal effluent.

In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune
stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses
were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.
I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks
of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial
infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the
details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this
diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the
difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed
a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you
understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal
therapy below).


The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor
mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being
considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween
infection.


>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals 
>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what 
>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling 
>Elaine's doctor a quack.

I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after
my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then
dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received
zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly
complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular
specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,
he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)
supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.
Call me carrot face.  :^)

Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to
all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for
example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had
good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order
improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is
not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.


>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides 
>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In 

Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that
I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my
sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that
demonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation
(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one
week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this
time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on
Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered
normal).

BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't
remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's
which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)
aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus
inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it
is relevant to this discussion.


>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
>the candida or not isn't certain.

My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic
response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.
Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow
part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a 
threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to
Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane
irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,
one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a 
Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.

BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival",
has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic
anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic
sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in
the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over
90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it
doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection
is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that
nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.

This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is
aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway
into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by
direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,
lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who
has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start
with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.


>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
>nondescript.  

This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the
appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture
the yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.

It's a real Catch-22.

Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that
no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not
up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which
should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should
be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to
convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,
you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to
compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study
needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get
funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the
smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other
doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes
into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get
nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.

It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have
*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to
noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable
hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence
to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would
also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - 
excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will
not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold
such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...

Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the

Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus
species can grow hyphae ("roots") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing
in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but
you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic
anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such
as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has
been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in
e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-
term treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It's like trying to weed a garden
by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come
out again once you walk away.

The $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partially
grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms
in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in the
classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive
bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that
is potentially lethal.

As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system
that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt
alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.
For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live
with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention
surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not
get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and
fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and
equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly
improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.
Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have
improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the
experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to "live with
it".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  The
anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction
because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those
having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.
Be sure to get the revised edition.)


>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic 
>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
>patients is a non-existent syndrome.

Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his
visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said "you'll just have
to live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and
non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now
shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road
to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a
systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of
anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own
practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-
"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,
"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly.
I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating
their moral obligations to help the patient.

Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are
confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical
yeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people
have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues
have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -
you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does
something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a
thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?
Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works
instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become
so enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients
they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which
we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when
you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach
(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having
exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional
medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I
went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,
and as a result I have found significant relief.

Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up
some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having
his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)
therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the
accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:
"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this
country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority
to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I
can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign
something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of
these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State
Board."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this
pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic
reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much
risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the
patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,
and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would
be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the
compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything
it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism
that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of
which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all
(true quackery).

I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.

Brave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one
develops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have
backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune
system, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual
desensitization.  I now kind of like being called "anal retentive" - it has
a nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the
post - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might
even cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...

Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also 
widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. 
And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is 
indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  
perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might 
make that he is unable to even leave the house.  

In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible 
and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these 
discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata 
--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  

If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and 
Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither 
of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since 
they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of 
a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. 
It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid 
grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton 
and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great 
deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost 
through the mistakes they made.

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and
sci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it's not supported by
carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."

Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies 
are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification 
of science.  

For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology 
results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside 
the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have 
no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this 
is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, 
it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has 
certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish 
arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment 
--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come 
with anything worthwhile.  

Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is
one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate
questions because they can be readily handled by the currently
fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional
or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to
those questions which seem to have fundamental significance.

For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with
statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.
(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many
areas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers
resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions
into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's
assertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors.")

I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental

My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle with
it, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she
complains that the print is too light for her taste.  The difference
is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is
adjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find it
objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some
people don't care for it and it is considerably different. 

I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black
vs. write-white engines when dealing with TeX drivers.  Is something
like that going on here?

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in
another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.
 
First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a
problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for
over two months.

The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare
cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly
soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections.

Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,
and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not
damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.

Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day. 

In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of
the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Digi-key has the NE-622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on

For a great combination of theory with actual circuits, the best

from the ARRL.  Most library's have it in the reference section.

Subject: Common-mode noise and small signals
Keywords: noise common mode
Organization: Iowa State University, Ames IA
Lines: 20

I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few 
questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform 
synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large
common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another
transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred 
times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to
make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with 
line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).

How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an
HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 
'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the 
input since it will read accurately down to DC.

Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, 
how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected 
to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused 
by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for 
use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would
appreciate it.

  If I'm wrong, god is free at any time to correct my mistake.  That
  he continues not to do so, while supposedly proclaiming his

  As for the trap, you are not in a position to tell me that I don't
  believe in god because I do not wish to.  Unless you can know my
  motivations better than I do myself, you should believe me when I
  say that I earnestly searched for god for years and never found
  him.

There is also the question of what is meant by "atheist".  A familiar
example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows.

The two statements following ARE consistent:

(1) I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks
(2) I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

The two statements following are NOT consistent:

(3) I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks
(4) I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

Statements (1) and (2) require no faith, they make no presumptions about
the nature of reality.  Statements (3) and (4) require belief.  Many
atheists (myself included) take the following position:

(5) I do not believe that there is a god.
(6) I do not believe that there is not a god.

That is , I harbor no beliefs at all, there is no good evidence
for god existing or not.  Some folks call this agnosticism.  It does not
suffer from "blind faith" at all.  I think of it as "Don't worry, be happy".

The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX. It is a ROM
upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more
efficient, speedier code that first became available in Adobe Type
Manager 1.0.

That software came out after the original NTXes and the so-called

Worse?  Maybe not, but it is definately a violation of the

should be changed to?  But I'm not personally as concerned
about the anthem since I don't come across it in daily

Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe
that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would
not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent
the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.
And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that 
would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank
goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine
that helps me.  

I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you
would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second
opinion, and then move on with your life.
Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in 
this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.
These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over
the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going
to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was 
helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very
unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,
make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.

A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what
I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not
a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are
only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us
out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing
piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things
that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,
or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because 
those things are much more tangible and have much more concise 
definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to
decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to
find your way out of it.


I have chosen the latter.

I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance

Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movement
like it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics 
to specify the current scale of the meter movement? I can cut
and paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what the

OPTICAL drives are SLOW, very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of Bernoulli.

Since I needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev

I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 Imams with you, although
my preference would be to move the discussion to another
newsgroup.  I feel a philosophy
or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply
embedded in the world view of Islam and the
esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter
into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric
religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical
substance of man's being and nature.

A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory
books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's "Fundamental's
of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe" - Mizan Press,
translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book
(if you can find a decent translation) is "Wilaya - The Station
of the Master" by the same author. I think it also goes under the
title of "Master and Mastership" - It's a very small book - really
just a transcription of a lecture by the author.
The introduction to the beautiful "Psalms of Islam" - translated
by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of
Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We
have these books in our University library - I imagine any well
stocked University library will have them.

From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You
should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable 
Shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the
charge of heresy is levelled.

	Hi,

	I have a problem, I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve.

	Background of the problem:
	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a 
	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain
	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming
	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.
	For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.

	My problem is this :
	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller
	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell
	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,
	else it is trivially rejected. 

	Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. 
	somewhere for doing this.

	Any help would be appreciated.

Yes, I do.  A couple of years ago, I did a comparison of the two
products.  Some of this may have changed, but here goes.

As far as a PHIGS+ implementation, Figaro+ is fine.  But, its PHIGS!
Personally, I hate PHIGS because I find it is too low level.  I also
dislike structure editing, which I find impossible, but enough about
PHIGS.

I have found HOOPS to be a system that is full-featured and easy to
use.  They support all of their rendering methods in software when
there is no hardware support, their documentation is good, and they
are easily portable to other systems.

I would be happy to elaborate further if you have more specific
questions.

FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles.

I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power
transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if
anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.

I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something
I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other
words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be
real difficult at 15 KHz).

 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the 
 belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.
 This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are
 conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have
 to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe
 in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at
 God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan
 except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond
 hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The 
 reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians
 have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.

  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a 
  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and
  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least
  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this
  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because
  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the
  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict
  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant
  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists
  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).

 Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist
 doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may
 just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:
 
 Strong atheism - "I believe god does not exist"   a positive belief

 Weak atheism   - "I don't believe in a god"       a negative belief
 
 these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of
 god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that
 you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)
 
 suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent
 as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas
 exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person
 not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that
 even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:
 
 christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god
 
 atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)
 
 atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set
 
 agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics
accelerators.  It's quite fast (I have 7), but as usual with new boards/chips
the drivers are buggy for Windows.  As far as Winmarks go, it depends upon
the version.  I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11.  2.5 yielded the
50+ number.  I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 (from memory
as well).

As far as the low-level stuff goes, it looks pretty nice.  It's got this
quadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points.

It's very fast, but beware of buggy drivers, and otherwise no non-windows
support.

  Yes, I do.  

  My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to
  kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)
  purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has
  almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing
  innocents, is unconscionable.

  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our
  transportation system are based on their merits to society, not
  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent
  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued
  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and
  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.

  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital
  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with
  no net positive gain.  Why?

  Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond
  that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life
  at all.  But I won't open that debate, as it seems others are
  tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.

From the benchmarks I've seen (was that in MacUser or MacWeek?) the FPU-less
Centris 610 is _faster_ at floating-point operations (the kind of calculations
that get routed to an FPU) than a Mac IIfx!

And a Mac IIfx (68030 @ 40MHz + FPU) is _the_ fastest 030-based Mac.

Take note, of course, that benchmarks never tell the whole story... Get your
favorite program(s) and run them on both machines at the store.  They should
let you do that before you plunk down a hefty amount...

Melissa, there is a simpler procedure called a "Dorsal slit" that is
really the first step of the usual circumcision.  It is simpler and
quicker, but the pain is about the same as circumcision after the
anesthetic wears off and the aesthetic result post healing is not as
good.  See your friendly urologist for more details.

consist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls them.
They strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing
LEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are available.
I've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states for
relaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc...
I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful,
The few sources I've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and a
friend who has tried them claims that "every home should have one"). So 
do these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induce
alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research if
any has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer?

Well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this
information.  But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)
shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I
believe).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The
computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red
(respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and "incident"--I might be off
a little on the speeds, since this is from memory).

I often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to
fight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little
while to wait for it to clear.

Another poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded
wire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  CalTrans
has had a "big board" driven from this data in their traffic control center
for some time.  I don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone
with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have
it.

We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have
_mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit),
various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select
lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.

Cute chip, 44 pin PLCC package.

Second sourcing may be a problem though :-(

If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be
there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt
supply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The
regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits
shut down the EHT supply section.

Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower
the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set
operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.

There are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the one
above several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler
module may be shot; that's fairly common.

It is illegal to perform acupuncture with unsterilized needles. No licensed
practitioner would dare do this. Also there is not a single documented case
of transmission of AIDS via acupuncture needles. I wouldn't worry about it.

Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when
an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of
the AC cycle?  A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?

I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps
in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with
zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays "quiet", AC-wise.
But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay
in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control
of my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets
one of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but
I'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having
to do some major rewiring/redesign.  A varistor would help but might not
be sufficient.  Ideas?

    You must not have tried very hard. I just opend mine in about 2
seconds. Take a look on the bottom, it has a dial that turns to open
much like the older ADB mouses used to have. It's a bit harder to turn

[...]

   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION
   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What
   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.

   [Reproduced without permission]

	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,
	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under
	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,
	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if
	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group
	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and
	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after
	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.
	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a
	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.
	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers
	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did
	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not
	necessarily go hand in hand.
	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining
	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.
	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the
	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins
	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-
	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in
	the amount of food eaten afterward.

	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing
	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a
	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government
	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing
	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.
	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and
	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm
	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the
	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with
	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's
	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration
	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a
	clean bill of health.
	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" of
	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed
	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take
	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of
	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,
	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...
	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams
	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups
	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content
	of selected foods omitted]
	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away
	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called
	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000
	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential
	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child
	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause
	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with
	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other
	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "Phenylketonurics:
	Contains Phenylalanine."

Greetings,
    I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale.  It emulates an HP 7570
or 7574 - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does
the emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I
also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16
packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,
7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color
pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.

    The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for
HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B
sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).

    I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at
least another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to
purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were
sealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to
function as well.

    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in
just them.

    I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color.

    I'd like $350 or best offer...

##

    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from
science.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into
your mouth either). 

   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can
not make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.

   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to
be scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making
such wild claims.

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.

Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other
monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be
specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this
problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc
several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the
juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side
of wall maybe?
We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input
lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference
effect on the computer monitor next to it. 
Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very
common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type
O'scopes).
I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount
around deflection coil of interfering monitor. 
BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH
VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T
BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO
MOUNT CAN.
Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also
good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on
monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other
sources.

My 6 year son is so plagued.  Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems 
to keep it under control.  But let him get bopped there, and he'll recur for 
days!  Also allergies, colds, dry air all seem to contribute.  But again, the 
vaseline, or A&D ointment, or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring.

Ok, I was under the impression that it accepted digital input.

I still don't know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and

"Birth Announcement" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe
                       Information Service
===================================================================
 
                     FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT
                     -------------------
 
                                     (SM)
                        EnviroLeague
 
A new youth movement,"EnviroLeague," was recently born, according to its
founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.
EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in
matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our
environment.
 
Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and
initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to
Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and
Objectives:
 
                           MISSION
 
   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members
   to foster and implement the improved education of young
   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards
   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition
   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,
   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue
   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall
   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the
   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,
   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in
   which we must all live.
 
                         OBJECTIVES
 
   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary
   objectives shall be:
       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many
            environmentally concerned organizations as
            possible, said Movement having as its primary
            focus the education and participatory
            involvement of young people in appropriate areas
            of environmental concern;
       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and
            their branches a full complement of program
            materials for their use, including suitable
            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written
            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and
            other items as shall seem appropriate and
            desirable;
       (3)  To serve as a "clearing house" for the exchange
            of program ideas, materials and information
            among said organizations;  and
       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned
            organizations to recruit and train the necessary
            adult leadership for their youth programs.
 
EnviroLeague will operate through three "Program Divisions" serving youth in
the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be
through formation of "EnviroLeague Teams," either by EnviroLeague itself or by
environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a
charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.
 
EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders
of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to
membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper
conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain
additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such
organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as
possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to
youth membership.
 
EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to
contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its
Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any
local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be
involved in similar functions at the national level.
 
Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the "draft"
portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the
EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes
place.
 
CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this
electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.
This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH
Forums.
 
The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO
EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named "EnviroLeague."
============================================================================
 
Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first
meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian
(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home
(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:
       EnviroLeague
       P.O. Box 418
       Peoria, IL  61651-0418
 
Those interested in starting an EnviroLeague Team might just establish
contact, to receive a diskette (IBM DOS, ASCII) with initial information.

Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the
distance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to
borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this
darling anyway. Btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors
you found to fire the solenoid -- High current drain on frozen batteries
can be an ugly thing.

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in
a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just
pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't
use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
access).

	Then let me ask you for a "workable" solution.  We have a name
here that implies certain things to many people.  Rather than trying
to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there
some "name" that would imply what this group was originally
intended for?  

	My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler
for "meaning".  In my "reality", psychoactives *technically* could 
range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
standard recreational drugs.  In practice I had hoped to see it
limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like
some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*
recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
effects -- the recent query about "bong water", I thought was a bit
off topic -- so I just hit "k".

	But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --
what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
discuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something
similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to
describe alot of those drugs.  There is a big difference between a
drug that if taken in "certain doses, over a period of days may have
a psychoactive effect in some people", vs. many of the drugs in
PIHKAH which *are* psychoactive.

If all of those are "is"'s of identity, both syllogisms are valid.
If, however, B is a predicate, then the second syllogism is invalid.
(The first syllogism, as you have pointed out, is valid--whether B
is a predicate or designates an individual.)

Humans have "gone somewhat beyond" what, exactly?    In one thread
you're telling us that natural morality is what animals do to
survive, and in this thread you are claiming that an omniscient
being can "definitely" say what is right and what is wrong.   So
what does this omniscient being use for a criterion?   The long-
term survival of the human species, or what?

How does omniscient map into "definitely" being able to assign
"right" and "wrong" to actions?

Well, your "original premises" have a habit of changing over time,
so perhaps you'd like to review it for us, and tell us what the
difference is between an omniscient being be able to assign "right"
and "wrong" to actions, and telling us the result, is.

I'm talking about the morality introduced by you, which was going to
be implemented by this omniscient being that can "definitely" assign
"right" and "wrong" to actions.

You tell us what type of morality that is.

I know of a similar incident about 3 years ago.  A climatologist( Ithink 
that was his profession) named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake 
would hit the New Madrid fault on Dec.3.  Some schools in Missouri that were 
on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day.  Many people 
evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are.  I wouldn't be suprised if 
there were more journalists in the area than residents.  Of course, teh 
earthquake never occured.  HOw do I know about his?  I used to live in 
Southern Illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the 
fault line.  No we still had school... We laughed at the poor idiots who 
believed the prediction. :):):):)

Summary: Instructions for Quadra 700 memory installation
Keywords: memory,quadra,700,install

This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own
memory.

1)  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots.

9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard.
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position.
	
10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

12) Replace the phillips head screw

13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

Well, letsee (whipping out HP-48SX, soon to be GX): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5
nanoseconds resolution.  Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!

The more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally
somewhere around 40kHz.  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light
(radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.

>What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous
"sonic estimator" type devices that do what you want here.  Many are pretty 
cheap too -- <$30.  (In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling
for something like $8.  That's the one I bought! :-) )

A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohn's

But she can't seem to eat certain foods, such as fresh vegetables,

Her question is: are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
problems of people with Crohn's disease ?

(I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric).

For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e.
stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is
also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think). 

In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For
that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam
projector, but sacrifice portability.

Oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you
want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that
light wash out your display at the front of the room. Tricky to get right.

Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would
you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to
build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.

pin 1:  signal ground
pin 2:  signal
pin 3:  always hot +6 volts
pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on
pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors

The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There
is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to
ground.

The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.
They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would
imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
it as the external receiver.

If you need more info, let me know.

As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in 
tomatoes?

Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something
is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer.

People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether
they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these
things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them?
How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner?

    The gl2p1.lzh stuff under gfx/show on the Aminet sites includes a
    utility called pic2hl, that is a filter for HamLab that can handle
    the most commonly used kinds of .PIC and .CLP files.

    The biggest problem is that the .CLP files don't usually contain a
    palette, so you need to convert a .PIC with the right palette
    first (which creates a "ram:picpal" file), and then convert the
    .CLP files.

No cookies, Charlie. The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited
as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence. In this case, it
is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been
seen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one would
hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of
a resurrection.
 
There have been more elaborate arguments made, but it looks as if they have

It is no evidence in the strict meaning. If there was actual evidence it would

MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental
restaurants might put a tad too much in them).  I've noticed that when I
go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get
a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many
of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the
time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)

So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that
MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.

Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly
harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should
be tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.

Read a history book, Fred. And tell me why so many religions command to

Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboard
switch?  The one in the back of the machine doesn't work either...
The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes,
then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately...
Sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time...

I remember hearing about this problem a long time ago, and that a logic

Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS:
958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;
1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.
For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.

Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was
unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this
soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods
were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".

The FDA, I believe.  Rules say no blood or blood products donations
from anyone who has been in a malarial area for 3 years.  I was a platelet

Not necessarily.  The same rules may not apply to organ donation
as to blood donation.  In fact, I'm sure they don't.

also occurs in small children on the hands, feet and genitalia.

Any information will be greatly appreciated.

Check out #27903, just some 20 posts before your own. Maybe you missed
it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of.

For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown
off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,
packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. 
Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his*
sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.

Charley,

I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers
to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your
previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you
cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once
again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for
you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the
questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may
address them one at a time for all to see.

Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I
will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at
such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat
this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or
you cease to post to this newsgroup.

I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these
questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be
kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too
pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it
from this list.

Now, to the questions...

1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological
patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating
that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some
atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed
were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed
to do so.  Please do so now.

Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your
stereotype?

Here is the context for the question:

>>> This is not true for everyone on this board, and you are out of line
>>> in assuming that it is.
>>
>>YOU, however, deleted the text further along where I said that I didn't mean
>>to imply that everybody's experience was along the same lines.  
>
>Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications, you do so
>repeatedly.  
>
>Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint: can you name
>those atheists that you've come across who *do not* fit into the
>patterns that you theorize?


2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that "senses and
reason are all we have to go by", and when pressed, you have implied
that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly
asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both
experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses
and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.

Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can
experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent
reasoning?

Here is the context for the question:

>>Revelation is not reason, and if we DO have revelation, then
>>reasoning is NOT all we have.

>First, show me that revelation exists.  Second, if revelation is not
>perceived through the senses, how exactly is it perceived?  According
>to my Webster's, revelation is "an act of revealing or communicating

then later...

3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by
a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify
one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do
so now.

Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and
fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.

Here is the context for the question:


>>I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent (if wrong :-))

>sense unverifiable or fantastical?  I demand that you retract this
>statement if you cannot offer up evidence.  If you follow your usual
>pattern of ignoring the challenge, then you are simply an asshole.


4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as
a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the
"axioms" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked
you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement
that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that
I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer
the question.  Please do so now.

Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become
atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that
effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the
subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably
result in atheism?

Here is the context for the question:

5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these
Challenges because they contained too much in the way of "included
text" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't
respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify
this seeming contradiction.

Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context
from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to
avoid "included text"?

Here is the context for the question:

First you said:

>>My ordinary rules are that I don't read articles over over 150 lines
>>or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first
>>screen.  THese are not rules of morality, but practicality.

then later...

>>If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position, then
>>they cannot be argued with.

From what I read, the other fellow told Salameh how to put it together

I read this in an article in "The Australian Muslim Times", the

If this is true, perhaps one of the Muslims based in North America (if
they see this posting) can elaborate.

I don't deny this fact.

The thrust of my argument here is that 

(a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found
guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is
wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.

(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps
have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is
_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and
_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important 
distinction.

I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say "Muslim".  In
general, anyone who calls themselves a "Muslim" and does not do or 
outwardly profess
something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam
is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to
Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a
Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential
principles, though, then one does leave Islam.

The term "Muslim" is to be contrasted with "Mu'min", which means "true
believer".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is
something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you
will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,
because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,
for example, am a "true believer" or not.  For example, I could just be
putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to
what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say "Muslims"
we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in
practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By
"Muslim" we do not necessarily mean "Mu'min", or "true believer" in
Islam.

  I have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons
attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax
anybody else. This seems to be ok for atheists. You don't get an atheist
knocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out
literature at a social event. Theists seem to think that thier form of
happy should work for others and try to make it so. 

  My sister is a 
born again, and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family
for several years. She finally got the clue that she couldn't help.
During that period she bought me "I was atheist, now I'm Xtian" books
for my birthday and Xmas several times. Our birthday cards would contain
verses. It was a problem. I told my mom that I was going to send my
sister an atheist piece of reading material. I got a "Don't you dare".
My mom wasn't religious. Why did she insist that I not send it ??

   Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to
preach, non-religion should be self contained. What a crock of shit.
I finally told my sister that I didn't find her way of life attractive.
I have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.

   I'm sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and WORST
OF ALL . . . . respected more than atheists. There must be an end
in sight.

No it didn't.  The motto has been on various coins since the Civil War.

Sure. Yes, I did. You see I don't think that rape and murder should
be dealt with lightly. You, being so interested in leniency for
leniency's sake, apparently think that people should simply be
told the "did a _bad_ thing."

Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible.

This is an argument for why _you_ don't like religions that suppress
sex. A such it's an irrelevant argument.

If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then 
fine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement
that sex is not the business of religion (one of your "arguments").

The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong
measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so
strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to
find a marriage partner.

I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a 
price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk
as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that
there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who
are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an 
Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that
Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus
no muslim is free from error. 


>As usual there seems to be almost as many Islamic viewpoints as there
>are Muslims.  

Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is
widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are
many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in
and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people
under the same name. 

>It all comes back to the Koran being so imprecise in its wording.

The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true
that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of
many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings
precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come
to agreement about them.

Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S?

I have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16" mode, the
picture won't
go very big. I end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top &
bottom. I suspect
an internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it?

Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or
off the main
raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the
screen is blanked.
This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens
I have
used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not
visible, the
real image virtually disappears!

The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too
much!

Oh, and I am using a RasterOps 24XLi card.

I've got an old demo disk that I need to view. It was made using RIX Softworks.  
The files on the two diskette set end with: .scf

The demo was VGA resolution (256 colors), but I don't know the spatial  
resolution.

First problem: When I try to run the demo, the screen has two black bars that  
cut across (horizontally) the screen, in the top third and bottom third of the  
screen. The bars are about 1-inch wide. Other than this, the demo (the  
animation part) seems to be running fine.

Second problem: I can't find any graphics program that will open and display  
these files. I have a couple of image conversion programs, none mention .scf

See, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant
if it is "voluntary."  Why do you think this?

And anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.

You are attaching too many things to the term "moral," I think.
Let's try this:  is it "good" that animals of the same species
don't kill each other.  Or, do you think this is right? 

Or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do
is either right nor wrong?

Those weren't arbitrary killings.  They were slayings related to some sort
of mating ritual or whatnot.

Yes it was, but I still don't understand your distinctions.  What
do you mean by "consider?"  Can a small child be moral?  How about
a gorilla?  A dolphin?  A platypus?  Where is the line drawn?  Does
the being need to be self aware?

What *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of
the same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  Don't
you find the fact that they don't at all significant?

That's a somewhat overbroad statement.  I'm sure there are HMOs in
which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's
income.  In most, however, including the one I work for, there is no
direct incentive to under-order.  Profits of the group are shared
among all partners, but the group is so large that an individual's
generated costs have a miniscule effect.  I don't believe that we
under-order.  Then again, I'm not really sure what the right amount
of ordering is or should be.  Relative to the average British
neurologist, I suspect that I rather drastically over-order.

Good question.  I'm sure some biologist could answer better than I,

Animals *can* be trained, but if they're instincts serve them well, there is

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I
came up with:
ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M
This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.
Quick summary of each commmand:
Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.
L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)
&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always on
S11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)

In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right
before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer 
function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra
14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.

In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed
the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, and
everything seems to work fine.

Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forward
this to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save other
newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, and
also save the net some redundant messages.  If anyone else has something
to add, feel free.

Even easier, my area supports 311.  Dial this and a recording recites your number.

I've had exactly the same problems in Aldus Freehand.  I think autotracing
is one of those "features" that barely works, but everybody feels compelled

I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You
think its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because
psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent
criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think
it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot.
Basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society
are far too complicated for us to control. We just have to hold on to the
panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing. But one
things for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not
due solely to sex out of marriage.

I tend to agree.  I came here when it first started and watched it grow
from the roots on talk.religion.misc.  It seemed to take a while for enough
atheists to come forward to get past the "Let's trash Xians" and such.
Now there's a stable core, and frankly there's a feeling that this is
_our_ group.

If we go mainstream, we're going to be in a lot more places.  And every
fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find Jeesus! and
warn us that we're all going to Hell.

Want to see what we'll get?  Go real alt.fan.brother-jed and imagine that
those imbecilic tirades will be here.  All the time.  Every other post.

I'm being selfish.  I find I really learn a lot here and the S/N isn't too
bad.  The Browns and the Boobys are a distraction, but they are few enough
that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them.  But
I greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping
level of the Conners of the world.

I think you are suffering from some alignment or color

as a Quadra rendering to screen.

What screen card you use does of course matter much (built-in
video is almost always faster than NuBus)

21" 24-bit screen on NuBus :-)

SOURCE: AP NEWSWIRE

The Vatican, Home Of Genetic Misfits?

Michael  A. Gillow, noted geneticist, has revealed  some unusual  data
after working undercover in  the Vatican for the past 18 years.   "The
Popehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur.", reveals Gillow in his
groundshaking report. Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost
workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair,
first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late
1950's.

"The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up. The  Vatican didn't
want the Catholic Community(tm) to realize  their  leader  was hefting
nearly  8 kilograms of extraneous  bone  tissue on    the  top of  his
skull.", notes Gillow in his report. "There are whole  laboratories in
the  Vatican  that experiment with tissue  transplants and bone marrow
experiments.  What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400's is now
scientifically engineered and bred for. The whole bone transplant idea
started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary
transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats." Gillow is quick
to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the
disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.

"When it becomes time to replace the pope", says Gillow, "The old pope
and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber. They  butt
heads much  like  male yaks  fighting for dominance of the  herd.  The
victor emerges and has  earned the privilege of inseminating the choir
boys."

You know, it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused
in this way.  It's ridiculously expensive, and potentially toxic.
The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough, so it gets abused by quacks.

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's (relatively) cheap
and when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any
systemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without
any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use
IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve
the "yeast" problem once and for all.

Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating
your symptoms.

Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket?  I'd hate
to think my insurance premiums are going towards this.

What do you mean "more comfortable putting it up to."  That seems a bit
hard to evaluate.  At least for me it is.  

Stare straight Point with both hands together and clasp so that only the
pointer fingers are pointing straight forward to a a spot on the wall about
eight feet away.  First stare at the spot with both eyes open.  Now
close your left eye.  Now open your left eye.  Now close your right eye.
now open your right eye.

If the image jumped more when you closed your right eye, you are right
eye dominant.

If the image jumped more when you closed your left eye, you are left eye
dominant.

Hi Janet,

Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms, 
same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people
I know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such
a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their
headaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learned
about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.

I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer).
Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before
playing rather than after.

Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.

I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in 
descending order of importance):

1) Heavy exercise
2) Sleep deprivation
3) Fasting		(e.g., skipped breakfast)
4) Physical trauma	(e.g., head bonk)

Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I 
don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of 
the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered 
this, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two 
or three years when I get cocky ("It's been so long, maybe I just don't 
get them anymore") and stop being careful.

Hope this is helpful.

John.

   I was just wondering one thing, actually two. ( I hope that this is the
proper place to post this subject)

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)
when stored on a concrete floor?  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted.  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them,
but he couldn't tell me why.

I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from
a MC146818A Real Time Clock.  Has anyone out there had some experience
in doing this?  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before
standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but
I thought that I had it worked out.  However, with a 32kHz crystal the
lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is
three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting
to create.

I have done the following things:

1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is
   low during this time.


2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or
   WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks very much,

Martin.

I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a
mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good
advice.

We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk,
and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB
disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken
floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some
problems:

The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only
connectors for one single hard disk drive.

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each
(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?

Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?

What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor
packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them
installed in the other disk.

The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets
ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.

It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an
external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.

Thank you!

Well now, we can't judge death until we are dead right?  So, why should
we judge religion without having experienced it?  People have said that
religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc.,
but I don't totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really say
how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion,
but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.

So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for
a given individual, or even for a general population.  We can say that
it is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to use
religion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you state
above).

Ricardo, the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
earlier post is plain old Quicktime 1.5 with the Compact Video codec.
I've seen digitized video (some of Apple's early commercials, to be
precise) running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely (16-bit
color depth). I would expect that using the same algorithm, a RISC
processor should be able to approach full-screen full-motion animation,
though as you've implied, the processor will be taxed more with highly
dynamic material.

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo

When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've
had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or
SCSI etc. 

(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't
want to slide out any more).

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for

I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN for
some time now.  I'm primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz)
designs, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well
as for your basic thin wire assumption.
Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself?  I've seen a version
that was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran, but I'm not
sure how many "new and improved" versions of the code might be out there

I'd also be interested in non-NEC derivatives.  The ones I've seen have

Hi:

I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor.
It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is
sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these
non-linearities are "Gamma-corrected" before encoding NTSC signals
or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.
 
Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do
these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC
monitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry
correct for "gamma errrors"?
 
Your response is much appreciated.

Two approaches that I've used: Tofranil, 50 mg qhs, Naproxen 250mg bid.
The Naproxen doesn't seem to be as bad as things like Tylenol in promoting

This is a good point, but I think "average" people do not take up Christianity
so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their
social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of
immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the
Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if
they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong
TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it
doesn't hurt anybody...

These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let's make sure to
alter the scond one so that includes something like "...let him be, as long as
he is not preventing others from finding their peace." or something like that. 
(Of course, I suppose, if someone were REALLY "at peace", there would be no
need for inflicting evangelism)

Well, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their
popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School,
I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this
time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also
immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross
generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it
ever has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions
that are chagning.  Who knows?
I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we
have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other:
I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put
arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.  Argumentation does not
really seem to apply to Christians (or even some atheists)- it must simply be a
step the person takes naturally, almost, "instinctively"...

Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac.
The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with
the correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable
(depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC).

If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBM-formatted disk
and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBM-PC
syquest.

good luck,

This, simply stated, is a result of the bankrupt ethics in
the healthcare and scientific medicine industries.

America is fed up with the massive waste and fraud that is costing
us 15% of our GNP to support these industries, while delivering 
marginal health care to the community.

Unfortunately, the "Clinton Plan", in whatever form it

Certainly we don't have all the answers.  The question is, what is the
most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge?  The
scientific method has proven itself to be reliable.  The *only* reason
alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their
practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific
scrutiny, insisting that "tradition" or anecdotal evidence are
sufficient.  These have been shown many times in the past to be very
unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  Crook's ideas have
never been backed up by scientific evidence.  His unwillingness to do
good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions.

source for several famous illumination models, including Bouknight, Phong,

Lines: 187
Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu
Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine

I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.
Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. 
Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women 
poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  

Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have 
no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that 
balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians 
who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go 
from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and 
then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling 
quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon
but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a 
quack.  

I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten 
years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were 
raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their 
farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to 
entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is 
about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition 
either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I 
know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at 
least a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really 
too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if 
they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the 
medical profession.

In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria after 
antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not 
have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria is 
needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all 
kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small 
and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are 
nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune 
system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike 
the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce 
toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of 
these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up 
residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this 
happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.
Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals 
and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what 
vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling 
Elaine's doctor a quack.

Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly 
called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.
Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it 
requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  

Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of 
normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing
factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral 
course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain 
much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in 
it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely 
survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides 
the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In 
diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little 
buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but 
some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on 
the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" it.
If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
nondiscript.  


Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in 
the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the 
vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system 
ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless 
they broach the mucus membrane "barrier".  If they do, an inflammatory 
response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A 
from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than 
they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin 
A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane 
barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong 
inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  

While diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause of 
this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which 
knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main 
competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are 
available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not 
use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of 
the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus 
inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum 
antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate 
just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring 
vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.

But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by 
the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to 
return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of 
the problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/or 
poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective 
therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving 
organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not 
grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is 
the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum 
antibiotics).  

In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good 
reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very 
favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and 
humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to 
minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  

If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even 
blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the 
bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology 
occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool 
for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first 
place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong 
but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan 
has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool 
specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of 
false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant 
basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have 
colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a 
doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.

Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria 
tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline 
during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. 
Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal 
problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of 
Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of 
the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina 
problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year 
until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting 
scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had 
the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some 
digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she 
used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex 
returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a non-existent syndrome.

The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria 
which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  
If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through 
aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.
But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system 
needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and 
some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans 
are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of 
the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent 
disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).
 
Some of the above material was obtained from "Natural Healing" by Mark 
Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human 
nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in 
the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely 
important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in 
the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida 
blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate 
intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI 
system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out 
grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and 
fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check 
once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.

If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, 
fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably 
accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin 
A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice 
from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our 
time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved 
your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly 
seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  Some highlights are...
32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integer registers 
& 8 80-bit floating point registers.  8K copyback capable caches,
4-way set associative.  Typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction.  5
clocks for a floating point multiply.

(interesting aside: the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit floating point
numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integers)

>2) Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...

More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching.  Figure
about 0.8 clocks per instruction typical (my guess).  But the Motorola
guys are pretty bright, it may be less.

Call Motorola.  I'm not typing it all in.

>I am hoping that the 68040 can win yet another battle against the intel people.

I'm predicting that both the 680x0 and x86 lines are reaching their
ends.  New experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can
schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  That sort
of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.

I finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly
impressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to
speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  And to get
that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch
target buffer.  Yes, I know they're talking about 100MHz processors.
Big whoop.  Designing a 100MHz board is difficult and really
expensive.  Priced 15ns memory chips lately?

Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N
(48cents).  A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold.  I guess
if you don't won't to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might
be worth the extra cost.  But 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly

No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to
suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the
Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My
comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors
that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.

What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.

I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a
previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around
for a while, rather than being flushed.

Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself
pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of
getting boned in the process.

Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we
aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,
for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs
and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers
every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.
The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That
means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I
have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one
previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other
vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.
And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I
could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're
supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).

Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a
corner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis.  
Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has
now changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with
and without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be 
important.  I find the dietician very important in my practice, and 
I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing
them, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories
and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.

This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is
a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to
be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not
put on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise
more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the
extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but
smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid
that this method will stop working someday, but usually
I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.
This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion
of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting
(that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle-
dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.

I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward
keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.

as if there are several different forms of each of these.

What I want to do, is settle on a file format which I can count
on as being a standard format 10 years from now.  I know Apple is going
to support Quicktime on the new Power PC's and, so this
may be the format of choice.

What format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products?  I guess
it is some kind of MPEG for their motion picture. Is it any different

First of all, I'm not your buddy!  Second, read what I wrote.  I'm not
talking about what muslims are ALLOWED to do, merely what *SOME*
practice.  They consider themselves as muslim as you, so don't retort
with the old and tired "they MUST NOT BE TRUE MUSLIMS" bullshit.  If I
gave you the names what will you do with this information?  Is a fatwa
going to be leashed out against the perpetrators?  Do you honestly think
that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess? 
With the kind of extremism shown by your co-religionaries?  Fat chance.

At any rate, there can be no conclusive "proof" by the very nature of
the act.  Perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in
theory, but hope that Allah will forgive them in the end.

I think it's rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims
in this regard.  Also, kind of silly.  Are you insinuating that because
the Koranic law forbids it, there are no criminals in muslim countries? 

This is as far as I care to go on this subject.  The weakness of your

I've got two CD300's... The first one i ordered Jan 15, and I received it Feb. 20.
The second one I ordered Jan 20th, and I just got it April 2nd or so. Anyway, they
both come with 10 misc. CDROMs... Things like a "Intro to Nautilis", a sample CD
of Kodak pictures, "From Alice to Ocean" (a story of a woman who treked across

disc (haven't checked most of these out yet). Also some "Cinderella" thing for kids,
a disc of Mozart something-or-others, etc. etc. etc. If someone's super interested,
I'll make a list of the exact titles and post them. They are all in the category of
"Interesting, but probably fairly useless...". It was rumored that the earliest 
units shipped with SOME encyclocpedia (it may have), but neither of my drives had
that.

 So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall
Damark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do
a sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don't
seem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to
heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats
only moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.

Issued by Khomeini it shouldn't be relevant to anyone. But issued

any muslim as it would be contrary to Islamic law which all muslims

Anyone sufficiently well versed in Islamic law and capable of reasoning,
if you are talking about a weak sense of "excuse." It depends on what 
sense of "excuse" you have in mind.

Why do you think Steere is doing this?  Isn't he acting in good faith?
After all, as the "discoverer" of Lyme for all intents and purposes,
the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets.  I don't
see the ulterior motive here.  It is easy for me to see it the
those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything.
There is a lot of money involved.

Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't
necessarily make you the most objective source of information
about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you
may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people
who may or may not have Lyme.  Certainly advocacy of more research
on Lyme would not be out of order, though, and people like you
can be very effective there.

A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the
WATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and
Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a
spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of
the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII
graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-
tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of
"tuning" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED.

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... 

Lindholm, L.E., and K.E. Oberg, "An Optoelectronic Instrument for Remote
On-Line Movement Monitoring", Biotelemetry, 1, 94-95, 1974.

Woltring, H.J., and E.B. Marsolais, "Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure-
ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report", Bull. Pros-
thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.

I don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to 
promote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... It 
pleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort of 
validated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but the 
practice was different....oh.
	If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of 
the national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very 
sure of the validity of your philosophy. I believe in 1946, the NHS was 
still having its nurses taught the fine art of "cupping", which is the 
vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing 
it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool.
	I wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath.

A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing.  The ringing is so loud
that she has great difficulty sleeping at night.  She says that she hasn't 
had a normal night's sleep in about 6 months (she looks like it too :-().
This is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on anti-depressants.

The ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  She is quickly losing
sleep, social life and sanity over this.

Does anyone know of any treatments for this?  Any experience?  Coping
mechanisms?  Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs?

Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to

I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on

Funny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated.
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow. 

Basically, though, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data.  It
seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up.

For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk.  I've got a Computer Engineering
degree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually
use.  Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers
upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
$7000/year lower!  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them.

This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators.
It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but
it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.
There are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.

There was a pneumatic amplifier designed by Alexander Graham Bell, as well,
but I don't know if it was ever constructed.

They are one of the largest manufacturers of IC packaging in the
world.

It sounds like you would be a good candidate for wafer probing or at
least IC probing to test performance.  HP, Cascade Microtech and
Tektronix should be able to help you here.  One note, testing at high
frequency accurately can be an *expensive* business.

It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
protection.  (Poor you!)

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you 
souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of 
copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to 
the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the 
protection.

One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape 
for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an 
extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR 
first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I 
don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want 
to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.

Those rules/regulations/laws would be subject to the same attack:  that

Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its
hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to
formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of
aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,
since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other
components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration
of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.
Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,
say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde
and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels
can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses
the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one
treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on
ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is
metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.
If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde,
it is actually relatively non-toxic.

joysticks for $13 and trackballs for $80.  They also have pinball parts.

Subject: polygon orientation in DXF?
Organization: University of New Mexico, Albuquerque

NNTP-Posting-Host: hydra.unm.edu


Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database
format used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores
the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a 
little and it seems that the points are stored in the order
they are drawn.

Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the 
points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,
but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know 
which direction the polygon should be visible from.

If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?
The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one
in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that
doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...

Thanks in advance for any help,

Ever heard of something called the placebo effect? I think Dyer is
reacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old
quackery over and over again.

It true that current medical knowledge is limited, but do you realize
just HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. It's playing the
lottery at best.

If the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mind
trying a little experiment to see if it is true? It would be quite
simple. Have sugar pills and have real pills.  Take one set for one
week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are
the real pills. Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results.
Let's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. If what you
are experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between
each week.

I recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and then
drips down onto the hot elements--whatever they are--that the extreme
heat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or more
carcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smoke.

Recently I posted two oscilliscopes for sale. One has sold, the other is
still available:
 Used, good condition:
 Hitachi V-422 40MHz Dual-Channel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
   o 1mV/div
   o DC offset
   o alternate magnification (10x magnified & non-magnified
     waveform)
   o VERT mode trigger
   o TV sync separation circuit
 List price      $910.00 (...and the price Fry's electronics just
                         quoted!) :-(
 Sells for       $699.99 (JDR MicroDevices current price)
                 $745.95 (Products International)
 Your price used $425.00 obo
...I haven't gotten an offer at the asking price, so 'obo' applies...

I also have a 'broken' version of the scope which sold:
 JDR 2000 20MHz Dual-Channel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
   o 5mV/div
   o Component Tester (resistors/caps/diodes/coils)
   o TV video sync filter
   o z-axis input (intensity modulation)

'Broken' means: The CRT produces a nice, bright trace, but the trace does
not correspond to the input signal. My guess is it's repairable but more
than a simple calibration problem...but I honestly have not tried to
calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it. It's 'as-is'.
I paid $60 for it in its current state (I bought it thinking I'd repair it,
using the 'good' scope for side-by-side comparison...since I've sold the
'good' scope, the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good) and I'd like to recoup
that amount. As above, I'll accept offers and take the best one.

I'd prefer a local (Bay Area, California) buyer, so (a) I don't have to
ship it and (b) she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase.

No, obviously talking about Research Assistants.  I favor a high protein,
low fat diet, barely adequate salary on a fixed time schedule, four hours
of sleep a night, continuous infusion of latte, unpredictable praise

lowered eyebrows, unrealistic promises of rapid publication, and 
every three months a dinner consisting of nothing but microbrewery ale

biggest "cult following", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any
tweaking.

The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are
backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in
effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &
all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order
directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and
they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...

USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;
it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable
and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model
from PC outlets for $190.

All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a
Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how
it works in two weeks or so.

Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws.
However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all
five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against
muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do
not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and
open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know
that
historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone
by the death penalty.

My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the
law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate
long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no
precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly
levelling death penalties for apostasy.

I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of "fasad". This
ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an
Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was
not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.

I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was
levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication
of the book. However, the charge of "fasad" can encompass a
number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations
broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that
the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from
circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the
"crisis". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not
the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are
levelled at people, not books.

The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the
issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,
presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of
secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people
crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. 
Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost
his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then
Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while
protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily
concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again
attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this
point that the fatwa on "fasad" was issued.

The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of
Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of
the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant
will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa
against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The
crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being
played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.

P.S. I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of "shatim" also
applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella
of the "fasad" ruling.

"On the Principles of Large Scale Computing Machines"
by Goldstine and von Neumann,

_John von Neumann: Collected Works, Vol. V_
reprinted here with absolutely no permission from anyone.
"We plan... to have a full size (40 binary digit) word hold
either contain
1 full size number (... equivalent to 12 decimal digits,
but we will use the first binary digit to denote the sign)
or two (20 binary digit) orders.
....
	It should be added that this technique of
automatic substitutions into orders,
i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders
(under the control of other ones among its orders)
is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. Thus, if
part of the memory is used as a "function table", then
"looking up" a value of that function for a value of the 
variable which is obtained in the course of the computation
requires that the machine itself should modify, or
rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which
controls this "looking up", and the machine can only make this
modification after it has already calculated the value of the 
variable in question.
	On the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its
own orders is one of the things which makes coding
the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as."

Short of changes by the feds, there is no way.  Codeine alone is very
difficult to prescribe without a lot of hassles.  Tylenol #3 is the

An Islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules
of Islam in regard to banking. This is done explicitly by the
bank. This was not the case with BCCI.

This is crap. BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other
international banks, with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with
outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments.

Back to childish propaganda again. You really ought to get a life

of Islamic banks operating throughout the world which no-one ever hears
about. If you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about
all the people who've been robbed by American banks.

NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create

controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat. If I 
remember correctly it was called a "modulated air blast transducer". There
were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 dB @ 80 Hz @ 10 mile

During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough

There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.

Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies
are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attack
by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property

As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not
willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which
is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest
purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.  

This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management
is accurate bookkeeping.  

If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it
would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What
was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the
methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  


In an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes:

First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I
don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,
homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be
accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of
homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  

What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things
(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific
attention.  

If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not
use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is
effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all
of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose
methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  

It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine
those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is
also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on 
those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous 
fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  

But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is
capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no
ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly
be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as
doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in
reason.

   Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say,
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve
those for c.s.m.a :-) )

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a
booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture
using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
(1.5).

   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite
nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by
3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he
increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know
what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.

   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was
from memory!

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some
hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the 
animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?

   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.

   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can
claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in 
my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer
low-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it, 
no longer CD-I.

Sure nails can be cruel.  I'd imagine nails in your eyes would be

   I have a new doctor who gave me a prescription today for something called

   to begin with.  Anybody ever taken this antibiotic.  Any good?  Suggestions

I've taken Septra.  My daughter has taken it many times for ear
infections.  It works sometimes.  It is a sulfa drug.  About the only
problem I found was that I'm sensitive and developed a rash after nine
days of a ten day course.  No more Septra for me.  My doctor was
remiss in not telling me to watch out for a rash.  I was quite in the
dark and didn't realize that it could be a drug reaction.  No harm
done though.

This was known long ago.  Brain produces and uses some MSG naturally,

Having said that, i might add, that in MHO, MSG does not enhance
flavor enoughf for me to miss it.  When I go to chinese places,
I order food without MSG.  Goos places will do it for you.
A prerequisite for such a service would be a waiter, capable of

Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is
probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle
busses running between the arena and the mall.

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA
office.  It should be free if you are an AAA member.

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly
good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.

        Yep... Alchemy works fine on my Tseng400+DAC, but I think I remember

One thing that I haven't seen in this thread is a discussion of the
relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty
acids (FAs).

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got
out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several
studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing
inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are
discussed in "Inflammatory Bowel Disease," MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]

But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be
picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In
the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the
studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the
_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed
layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are
consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoid
products to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad."
Isn't this ratio the issue?

What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA
supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs
appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the
low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).

I don't think such tools exist either. In addition, there's no such
thing as objective information. All together, it looks like religion
and any doctrines could be freely misused to whatever purpose.

This all reminds me of Descartes' whispering deamon. You can't trust

It would help if you (and anyone else asking for medical information on
some subject) could ask specific questions, as no one is likely to type
in a textbook chapter covering all aspects of the subject.  If you are
looking for a comprehensive review, ask your local hospital librarian.
Most are happy to help with a request of this sort.

1: "90% of diseases" is not the same thing as "90% of patients".

   In a world with one curable disease that strikes 100 people, and nine
   incurable diseases which strikes one person each, medical science will cure
   91% of the patients and report that 90% of diseases have no therapy.

2: A disease would be counted among the 90% untreatable if nothing better than
   a placebo were known.  Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingly
   dispense placebos...

Pardon me?   *I* am trying to apply human terms to non-humans?

I think there must be some confusion here.   I'm the guy who is
saying that if animal behaviour is instinctive then it does *not*
have any moral sugnificance.   How does refusing to apply human
terms to animals get turned into applying human terms?

Converts to xtianity have this tendency to excessively darken their

effort to "destroy" xtianity is suffering from deep megalomania, a

(sigh!)  Perhaps Big J was just mistaken about some of his claims.
Perhaps he was normally insightful, but had a few off days.  Perhaps
many (most?) of the statements attributed to Jesus were not made by
him, but were put into his mouth by later authors.  Other possibilities
abound.  Surely, someone seriously examining this question could
come up with a decent list of possible alternatives, unless the task
is not serious examination of the question (much less "destroying"
xtianity) but rather religious salesmanship.

Don't bother.  Many of the "prophecies" were "fulfilled" only in the

Isin't there some kind of rule (regulation, law, whatever) in some

so they get covered by the same regulation?

It's really not that hard to do.  There are books out there which explain

hidden line removal are pretty easy.  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht

It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily
very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what
is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little
over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different
thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),
but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating
meat may be perfectly legal.

No.  Often the answer is "we are".  But if society is those who make
the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should
make the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either,
but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things

Because sometimes that's necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when
it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.

#
#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?

IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various
kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive 
the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of
liar's paradox: "force is necessary for freedom".   One possible justification
is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if
their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if
we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.

What I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may
also be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don't let yourself
do it.  Eating meat, for example.

This isn't true.  Many people are forced to use the "automobile system."

But I think that the Court system has been refined--over hundreds of
years in the US, Britain, and other countries.  We have tried to make
it as fair as possible.  Can it be made better (without removing the
death penalty)?  Besides, life imprisonment sounds like a fatal punishment
to me.

This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some
aluminum foil down to work on.
	1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.
	2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,
		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.
	3. Remove the flopy drive.
	4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting
		the supply straight up and out.
	5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom
		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.
	6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and
		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then
		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the
		board must be removed first)
	7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).
		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.
	8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins
		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.
	9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder 
		them in.
	10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.
	11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 
		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and
		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a
		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole
		in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using
		insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat
		sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.

	12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

	    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will
	    void your warentee.

Hello all!

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D
(predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac
IIvi.

With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra
video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not
to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.

But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating
Apple 13" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local
distributor of NEC.
With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of
the time or every now and then.
But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows
etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts
sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some
"spiky" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing
pull-downs etc.
With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only
sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a
picture clear enough to shut down from menu...
With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but
sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely
lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.

I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but
with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?

I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can,
at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin
assignment for NEC 3D.
I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and
isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be
arranged, especially syncs and groundings.

Yes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works
perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and
also Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.

Here are the pinouts & stuff:

15 pin mini D-sub (NEC 3D)		15 pin D-sub (Mac, at least Quadra)

1  Red Video				1  Red GND
2  Green Video				2  Red Video
3  Blue Video				3  Composite Sync
4  GND					4  Sense 0
5  GND					5  Green Video
6  Red GND				6  Green GND
7  Green GND				7  Sense 1
8  Blue GND				8  NC
9  NC					9  Blue Video
10 GND					10 Sense 2
11 GND					11 C.Sync & V.Sync GND
12 NC					12 V.Sync
13 H.Sync				13 Blue GND
14 V.Sync				14 H.Sync GND
15 NC					15 H.Sync
SHELL GND				SHELL GND

	Yes there is.  Not common for CB.  The pattern is different (sort of
	a cloverleaf, with four main lobes.

	Use of anything under 1/4 wave for transmitting is very uncommon.  (The

	quarter wave.
	I reccomend the ARRL Antenna Handbook, or a good basic book.

I have a Fujitsu M2322K which has been removed (I believe) from a digital
X-Ray machine (takes X-Ray pictures without film).  The Fujitsu part number
is B03B-4745-B002A.

I have obtained some data on the device, it is 8-inch winchester-type
of 168 megabyte capacity (though I was told it was over 800 megabytes).
However, there is very little information on the interface standard used.
It appears to use two balanced-line connections, but what each connection
corresponds to I know not. One connection is a 30-way IDC, the other a
60-way IDC.

If anyone has any information on this device, I would be most grateful
if you could provide it.

Thanks.

                       Constructing a Logical Argument

Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument
found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to
logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.

Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise
OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether
it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to
study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic
knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an
argument.

Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally
applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely
explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is
the right tool for the job.

Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A
proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It is
raining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to
be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning
of "deny", not the everyday meaning.

The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular
arrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists a
God" both express the same proposition.

An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of
statements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists of
three stages.

First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to
continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They
are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. 

Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because",
"since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed with
suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious
premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to
question it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious" when
you've heard the explanation.)

Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known
as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of
one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of
valid inference.

The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further
inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or
"therefore".

Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which
is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often
indicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude"
and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.

For example:

Every event has a cause (premise)
The universe has a beginning (premise)
All beginnings involve an event (premise)
This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)
Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)

Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another
argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with
respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.

Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,
the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated 
afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if 
sometimes a little confusing.

Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or
conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever
producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some
statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:

"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,
 or the Son of God."

This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert
the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its 
conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll
come to those later.)

Another example:

"God created you; therefore do your duty to God."

The phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neither
true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an
argument.

Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A because
B".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the
statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then
it is not an argument, it is an explanation.

For example:

"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not
 start." -- This is an argument.

"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."
 -- This is an explanation.

There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A
deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions
-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must
also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid
argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the
conclusion is true.

An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the
truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;
however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other
arguments, and about how probable their premises are.

There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive
nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive
arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.

It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does
not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly 
counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more
carefully.

Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an
argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. 
For example:

   All insects have wings (premise)
   Woodlice are insects (premise)
   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)

Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. 
If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. 
The argument is thus entirely valid.

More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,
as in:

   All fish live in the sea (premise)
   Dolphins are fish (premise)
   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)

However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid
inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" for
implication.

The symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion. 
"T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.

Premise Conclusion Inference
   A        B        A=>B
----------------------------

                             the conclusion must be true.

A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound 
argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse
valid arguments with sound arguments.

To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require
lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably
more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing
an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.

In everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs
as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair
enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of
technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or
convincing.

So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical
argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect
when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being
misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be
exhaustive.

ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)

The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the
threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It
is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right". 
The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.

For example:
"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who
refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."

ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM

Argumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".

The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying
to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or
people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an
assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.

For example:
"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."

Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by 
showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of
reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not
argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's
testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the
Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).

The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person
argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of
the opponent's particular circumstances.

For example:
"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue
otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?"

This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing
the opponent's argument.

This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For 
example:

"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. 
You're white."

This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's
adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is
also known as "poisoning the well".

ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM

Argumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacy
occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it
has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that
something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this
is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved
true, a basic scientific principle.)

Examples:
"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise."

"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has
shown any proof that they are real."

Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is
generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.

Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce
certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can 
validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:

"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water
to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,
even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no
such flood occurred."

In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has
not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,
however.

ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM

This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is 
committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a 
conclusion accepted.  For example:

"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me
guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan."

ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM

This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To
commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by
appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often
characterized by emotive language.  For example:

"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women."

"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying
to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"

ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM

This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of
asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more
likely it is that that proposition is correct.

ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM

The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win
support for an assertion.  For example:

"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."

This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference
to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a
discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly
between:

"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"
and
"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent
 computer"

Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black
hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable 
whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.

THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT

The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a
particular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule is
inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the
specific.  For example:

"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must
dislike atheists."

This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide
every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.

CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION

This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one
forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not
representative of all possible cases.

For example:
"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are
insincere."

SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER

A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a
particular situation in which the features of that particular situation
render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a
hasty generalization.

NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

These are known as False Cause fallacies.

The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the
cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For 
example:

"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God
cured me of the headache."

The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to
be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For 
example:

"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid
atheism for the same reasons."

CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that
because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves
no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.

PETITIO PRINCIPII

This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the
conclusion reached.

CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO

This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one
wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the
fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:

"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any
government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. 
Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open
to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government
office."

Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the 
conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason
for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. 
Another example is the classic:

"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the
Bible is true because it is the word of God."

COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION

This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded 
question:

"Have you stopped beating your wife?"

The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not
even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,
when they ask questions like:

"Where did you hide the money you stole?"

Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:

"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"
or
"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"

IGNORATIO ELENCHI

The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument 
supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do
with that conclusion.

For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the
teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length
that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he
argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.

Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse
emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more
favourable light.

EQUIVOCATION

Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different
meanings in the same argument.  For example:

"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it
remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a
license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."

AMPHIBOLY

Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because
of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.

ACCENT

Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,
the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are
emphasized.  For example, consider:

"We should not speak ILL of our friends"
and
"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"

FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION

One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts
of something must apply to the whole.  For example:

"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very 
lightweight."

The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number
of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:

"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars
are less environmentally damaging than buses."

FALLACY OF DIVISION

The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like
its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a
property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:

"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."

The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by
each item.  For example:

"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."

THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT

This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful
events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the
first event.

For example:
"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin
and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot
legalize marijuana."

"A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIES

These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way
similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.

Examples:
"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of
history?"

"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a
form of Christianity?"

"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of
animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?"

AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A
is true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for
implication given earlier.

DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B
is false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is
a fallacy.

Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has
the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT in
fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is
invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce
anything about B.

CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL

This fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".

ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM

This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply
because it is old, or because "that's the way it's always been."

ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM

This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of
asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer
than something else.

ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM

The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those
with more money are more likely to be right.

ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM

The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or
more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the
argumentum ad crumenam.

ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM

This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the
more often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employs
constant repetition in asserting something.

BIFURCATION

Also referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when
one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other
alternatives exist or can exist.

PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS

This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex
question.

NON SEQUITUR

A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises
which are not logically connected with it.

RED HERRING

This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue
being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the
points being made, towards a different conclusion.

REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION

Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.

SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF

The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or
proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad
ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who
denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is
the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.

STRAW MAN

The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it
can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,
then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a
fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been
made.

THE EXTENDED ANALOGY

The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general
rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two 
different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a 
claim that those situations are analogous to each other.

This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about 
anti-cryptography legislation:

"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."

"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported
 Martin Luther King."

"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the
 struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!"

TU QUOQUE

This is the famous "you too" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to
be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:

"You're just being randomly abusive."
"So?  You've been abusive too."

Ming-zhou Liu's main problem is that he has an incompetent
physician -- himself.  This physician has diagnosed a problem,
even though he probably has never seen the diagnosed disease
before and has no idea of what kinds of problems can present
similar symptoms.  This physician now wants to treat his first
case of this disease without any help from the medical community.

The best thing Ming-zhou Liu could do is fire his current
physician and seek out a better one.

I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder,
I think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in
SCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main
file menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions,
of course, in which case you're on your own!!!

Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time)
did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the
pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an
afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow
strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!

The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill -
so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then
grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the
final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the
shape of the object being filled!!!

Of course, if the recorder isn't a QCR, you can ignore all
this and feel suitably :-)

Cheers, Toby.

I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).
It is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest
drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the 
drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures
are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of
performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC
and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the 
differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according
to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.
I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak
including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI
and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands
are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 
105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges
are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.
Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli
drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more
reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to 
getting my hands on one.

For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2

controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.

The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National
Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would
like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to
implement in my circuit.

BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas
Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer
Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM
memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the
power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use
this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).

It is used to create a TIN (triangulated irregular network), which is
basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of
points.  What is special about it is that the triangles formed are the 
most equalateral possible.  Check out "Proceedings of AutoCarto N" where

The problem is not precisely defined above, but if you need to find
the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon, then
you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon.  There
are two ways to do this:  use a somewhat tricky but by-now well
examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary,
or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull
routine and accept O(n log n).  Both methods are discussed in
Preparata and Shamos, for example.

Why so up tight?  FOr that matter, TIFF6 is out now, so why not gripe
about its problems?  Also, if its so important to you, volunteer to
help define or critique the spec.

Finally, a little numerology:  42 is 24 backwards, and TIFF is a 24 bit
image format...

Herman, I would think you of all people would/could distinguish
between "health" and "treatment of disease." All the prevention
medicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health.
You can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough
to have a disease which can be treated. A rich person with a
terminal disease is a bit out of luck. There is no such thing
as "adequately covered" and there never will be. 

And for what it's worth, I'll be the first to admit that all my
patients die.

After reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadra

claim. I pulled out my Variable Speed Overdrive and the motherboard's
50 mhz clock chip. I put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a
64 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's.
I can't believe it. It actually works. I'm not getting SCSI timing errors
either. This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results.
Did I spend all that money on the VSO for nothing? If this keeps working,

So that still leaves the door totally open for Khomeini, Hussein
et rest. They could still be considered true Muslims, and you can't
judge them, because this is something between God and the person.

You have to apply your rule as well with atheists/agnostics, you
don't know their belief, this is something between them and God.

So why the hoopla about Khomeini not being a real Muslim, and the
hoopla about atheists being not real human beings?

	With relays alone, you will always get a transient when
you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear
the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator
is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,
THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.

	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors
in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few
thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which
drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices
are cheaper than relays.

Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which
are connected by at least one edge.

If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.  

If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface "flips" when
you travel across that edge.  This is bad.  

Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise
acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the
surface enforcing consistency with that edge.  

    0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as "OK"
    1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)
       make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face
       should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which
       are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as "OK",
       and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially
       inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)). 
    2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.

If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you
lose. 
    
Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means
that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding
which way is OUT is left as an exercise...

Hi there,

I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone
here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but
are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an
intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.

*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it
*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a
*** different version.

The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They
are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,
anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a
"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with
no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a
simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256
color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".

The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip 
It is zipped with pkzip 2.04g

It is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do with
it whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due,
and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)

For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an
epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of
knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical
basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?
 
There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence
of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses
word "on faith", we just mean that having found this person to be
reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.
If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about
gods?
 
The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then
one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,
rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith
is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable
basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at
other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable
knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than
theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other
knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than
Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?
 
I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't
require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that
there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and
simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until
contrary evidence is found.

This doesn't sound right to me.  Don't Quadras use the 53C96?  If so, the
Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the
chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt
synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.

Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra.
On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the
Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind
mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396, the
handshake is entirely handled by the chip.

                       Gonorrhea -- Colorado, 1985-1992
                       ================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     The number of reported cases of gonorrhea in Colorado increased 19.9% 
from 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s. In comparison, in 
the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall 
decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in 
gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of 
this disease from 1985 through 1992. 
     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department 
of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, 
reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively 
(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics 
(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases 
with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% 
of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by 
age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or 
equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all 
reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the 
largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age 
group-specific rate (639 per 100,000). 
     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver 
metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the 
state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area 
occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods 
considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. 
     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among 
men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in 
the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits 
by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases 
diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, 
the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 
94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among 
self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, 
respectively). 
     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, 
university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted 
to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea 
culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 
23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the 
fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). 
     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and 
Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks

increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado 
increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, 
the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for 
whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) 
(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 
1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases 
increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 
may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more 
complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH 
surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea 
cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories 
suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. 
However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning 
laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the 
gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. 
     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in 
Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a 
recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs 
(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area 
coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires 
further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated 
previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) 
-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom 
gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, 
and gang affiliation. 
     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the 
national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 
19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for 
gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at 
greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-
specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as 
socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. 
     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, 
interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting 
partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at 
increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black 
males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio

announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in 
schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted 
primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to 
perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational 
interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of 
members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders 
and health-care providers.

                Effectiveness in Disease and Injury Prevention
            Impact of Adult Safety-Belt Use on Restraint Use Among
            Children less than 11 Years of Age -- Selected States,
                                 1988 and 1989
            ======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and 
young adults in the United States and account for more than 1 million years of 
potential life lost before age 65 annually (1). Child safety seats and safety 
belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 
states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety 
belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by 
an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major 
cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of 
occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for 
those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In 
addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to 
use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between 
adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints 
for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC 
analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this 
study. 
     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 
18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, 
random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury 
Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 
(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent 
was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for 
that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in 
this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than 
consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). 
Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software 
for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates 
and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined 
by p values of less than 0.05. 
     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six 
(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no 
law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, 
and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a 
vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse 
of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary 
enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a 
safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection

Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states 
used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. 
The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law 
requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law 
(no-law states). 
     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not 
consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and 
adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square 
test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 
43.2%, respectively). 
     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 
year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than 
consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported 
high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age 
(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for 
adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-
occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% 
for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of 
consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult 
safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age 
groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). 
     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded 
that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, 
higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with 
increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated 
with increased adult safety-belt use (8). 

Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. 

Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others 
indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely 
to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these 
nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit 
other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater 
risk for motor-vehicle injury (10). 
     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with 
child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs 
should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low 
educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such 
programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve 
low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are 
directed at parents with young children. 
     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In 
addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as

they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, 
those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do 
not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety 
belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and 
safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may 
increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- 
the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the 
highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

 SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES
                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC 
                        AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 

     Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance 
systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance 
in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for 
the years 1983-1988. 
     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program 
and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-
based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The 
prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-
1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan 
Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, 
sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. 
     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal 
alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the 
kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general 
diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand 
limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are 
probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these 
defects are relatively easy to diagnose. 
     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy 
termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, 
the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be 
related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene 
pool, or random variation. 
     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several 
collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in 
the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on 
the impact of prenatal diagnosis. Authors: Jane Schulman, Ph.D., Nancy

                      INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89

     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza 
virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually 
from October through May. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance 
conducted from October 1988 through May 1989. 
     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices 
of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO 
collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza 
viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and 
territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. 
Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received 
throughout the year. 
     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B 
viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency 
overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted 
over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices 
of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were 
similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of 
identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype 
increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 
1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were 
reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza 
A(H1N1). 
     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of 
influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the 
importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since 
amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. 
     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced 
throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make 
informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual 
surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates 
for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.

                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies

Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-
ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been 
developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), 
embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, 
these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive 
technology (ART) procedures. 

Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or 
pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility 
management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to 
proceed with one of the ART procedures. 

Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility 
service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and 
Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in 
ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients 
in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the 
traditional therapies. 

The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our 
Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the 
realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: 

o in vitro 
o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube 
  transfer 
o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. 
This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed 
towards improved success of these technologies.

                           Future Areas of Research

In addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the 
management of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist 
couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary 
disease. 

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then 
subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA 
amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. 

There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by 
other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and 
hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ 
hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of 
which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit 
sex-linked disorders. 

The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that 
it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility 
of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth 
of affected children.

               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the
                           Management of Infertility

The following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona 
Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. 

     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our 
Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of 
unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and 
the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred 
to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under 
strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being 
processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our 
andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-

assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to 
perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically 
stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing 
hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo 
lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs 
obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic 
egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, 
we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our 
Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  
     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal 
deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male 
factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall 
success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per 
cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 
IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. 
     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is 
disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological 
factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well 
recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous 
ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle 
attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant 
of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an 
Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of 
traditional therapies. 
     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not 
been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs 
available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates 
significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; 
and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is 
unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our 
Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may 
be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that 
fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant 
proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, 
the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our 
program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs 
of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. 

     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, 
usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves 
introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian 
tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization 
occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, 
with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for 
transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such 
pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility 
and/or idiopathic infertility.    
     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 
indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained 
with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 
percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might 
expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our 
program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while 
substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the 
patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing 
a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing 
general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from 
obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, 
and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. 
     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial 
environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between 
January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT 
cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. 
     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when 
embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. 
This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for 
success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical 
issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated 
by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from 
both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs 
should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. 
     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, 
is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but 
who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in 
combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 
percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the 
procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under 
the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm 
through enzymatic digestion. 
     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 
percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly 
relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. 
Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques 
for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such 
efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology 
offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to 
establish conception.

I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat
uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" and
"rationality" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this
newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.

What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps
even the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that
sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the
context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational
and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then
weeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this critical
function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.
If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are
subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true
of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.
This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)

True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is
*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have
resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply
do not generalize well to the actual history of science.

You miss the point entirely. Things defined by contradictory language
do not exist. Though something existing might be meant, conclusions
drawn from the description are wrong, unless there is the possibility
to find the described, and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of
the described then. Another possibility is to drop the contradictory
part, but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented
and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well.

Neither am I. But either things are directly sensed (which includes
some form of modelling, by the way) or they are used in modelling.
Using something contradictive in modelling is not approved of.
Wonder why?
 
We remain with the question if something contradictory can be sensed
as contradictory. An important point is that either one manages to
resolve the contradictions or one is forced not to use or to refer
to the contradictory part in drawing conclusions, or one will fall
in the garbage in garbage out trap.

First of all, infinity is a mathematical concept created by humans
to explain certain things in a certain way. We don't know if it actually
applies to reality, we don't know if anything in the world is infinite.

You don't know if the universe is actually continuous. Continuum is another
mathematical concept (based on infinity) used to explain things in a certain
way.

I have a pretty good idea of what infinity is. It's a man-made concept, and
like many man-made concepts, it has evolved through time. Ancient Greeks had
a different understanding of it.

Precicely. We don't even know if infinity applies to reality.

By '8 grey level images' you mean 8 items of 1bit images?
It does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit
in your screen and if the screen intensity is non-linear.

With 2 bit per pixel; there could be 1*c_1 + 4*c_2 timing,
this gives 16 levels, but they are linear if screen intensity is
linear.
With 1*c_1 + 2*c_2 it works, but we have to find the best
compinations -- there's 10 levels, but 16 choises; best 10 must be
chosen. Different compinations for the same level, varies a bit, but
the levels keeps their order.

Readers should verify what I wrote... :-)

A 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100
bet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule.  The Phillips
rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are
already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the
commercial release date.

By the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of
3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip
sets will be in full production.  The number of software companies
designing titles for the box will be over 300.

How do I know this?  I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters
last week.  Some folks were bullshitting a little too loudly about

I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much
more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and
some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,
in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their
54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple,
repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more
complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope
in "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time
being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to
the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling
rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but
before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.

Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz
sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front
end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for
equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really
only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single
sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.

So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for
general use and the digital for events where I need storage for
later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability
of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to
fall...

There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time 
_alone_ would cause an incompatibility.  There would have to be another 
difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  I've often used 
memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.  As long as it's
as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.

Just out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or 
were you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it?  Also out of 
curiosity, do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to (as 
I'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on).

There's no data that sugar-coated cereals cause seizures.  I haven't
even seen anything anecdotal on it.  Given how common they are eaten
- do you know any child or adolescent who *doesn't* eat the stuff? -
I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now.
Also, there's nothing weird in those cereals.  As far as the brain
is concerned (except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as
galactosemia), sugar is sugar, regardless if it is coated on cereal,
sprinkled onto cereal, or dissolved in soda, coffee or whatever.

There was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering
seizure thresholds, but I don't believe anything ever came of it.

Brad,
   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way 
to get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The 
"gain" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred 
direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.

Not even in sub panels!  The only place the neutral should be connected to the
ground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT!  In your house the "main" panel serves as
the service disconnect.  Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must
maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service
disconnect equipment.

It's not the fact that it can't exist that bothers me.   It's 
the fact that you don't seem to be able to define it.

This is not news.  In fact it's where I got the idea from, since it was
such a neat item.  Mattell made it, I believe, modeled after a "space

character graphics.  I should have protected it when I had the chance.

I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,
but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,
the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this
from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's
hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,
if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,
the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing
problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress
a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.

Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes
in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.
Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since
they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)

From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet 
circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving 
a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The
detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar 
detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there 
are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't 
paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the
roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. 

I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and 
how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector 
in a proper RF shielded enclosure.

Basically, any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy

Florida.  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets
and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.

I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned
me not to use US mail.  I did (although I did insure the shipment), and 
apparently Techworks got it.

My minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
different people.  I ordered DUO memory, thinking I got their "best" price
because of my employeer.  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering
developers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,
and was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited
my card for about 16% of the purchase price.   I like techworks quality
and installation instructions (and they include powerbook tools), but 
for out-of-CA purchases (no sales tax) chip merchant seems to be a bit less.

The STANDARD AT bus (ISA) runs at 8MHz, not 12.5 MHz, but some 
non-stnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  For instance, my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.

The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus 
operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.

Hmmm.  The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction
the first poster's brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if I
should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal
size.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time, but
that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to,
but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that
next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this
was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't
get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.  

This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a
different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work
that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some
people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor
their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet
like a hawk and use insulin regularly.  

I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to
it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy
sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't
necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.

There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding
practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:

The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or
the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to
carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the
voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It
should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the
normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in
the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding
conductor.  

Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages
on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding
conductors to provide reliable operation  ("orange" outlets are often used for
this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in
many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read
both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on
installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated
grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors
back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service
entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many
of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide
a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. 

The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is
referred to in the code as the "identified" conductor and is supposed to be
white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in
most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance
panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household
service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which
attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  

The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In
the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the
circuit from the panel to the load device.  

Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding
conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance
from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but
measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,
under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the
grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of
the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since
there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also
no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment
has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the "U"
ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. 
The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few
tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not
present a shock hazard.  

HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact
with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,
a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to
flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you
will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)
Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in
some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of
inadequate size, causing it to overheat.

With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a
short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may
flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which
increases the possibility for shock or fire.  

Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on
the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often
causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in
technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.

The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as
well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for
lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back
to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded
objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses
quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the
dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it
flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause
corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,
and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop
between the "hot" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the
water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. 
(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not
it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)

Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any
sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service
entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have
a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this
application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the
grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding
screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above
ground, with the possible problems listed above.

The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one
building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be
used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate
wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. 
These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days
before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to
have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to
have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place
of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate
neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings
(since most current is in the 220 volt "hots" except at some low settings, the
wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. 
So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,
it's primarily for lightning protection.

People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding
conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in "romex" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere
there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good
grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes
is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under
the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this
aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does
its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall
tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding
locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  

"Greenfield" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty
sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have
the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and
inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the
greenfield.

"Wiremold" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes
often prevents good contact, and the "feed" to the wiremold extension is often
from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold
box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and
the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were "hot" with
120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator
here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one
of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a
ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in
the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can "bond" the wire to the
box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.

On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets
when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them
without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the
protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't
install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is
desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is
connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,
whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something
provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded
GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93
code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be
renumbered though.) 

We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more
to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

The make some amazing IRLED's.  The really high-powered devices are arrays of
3, 6, or 9, LED's on a TO-66 header.  The 9-chip model puts out 6.5 Watts in
response to a 5 Amp, 10 uS. pulse at a .5% duty cycle.  I think  these are
designed as illuminators for IR vision systems.

I would also be interested in the application here.  I work with a Dance and
Technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot
wide stage from 50 feet away.

It's not a cycle.  Free helium will escape from the atmosphere due to
its high velocity.  It won't be practical to recover it.  It has

No.  No.  NOOO!!!

The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it
under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in
it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if
you're grounded in some other way at the same time.  

The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for
the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you
plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly 
measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  

They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,
repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things
like sub-panels.)

What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,
depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.

There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and
news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and
you should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy
to you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in
the future.

To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information
already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:

A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to
200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed
inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the
same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate
must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits
at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national
Instruments, at the same sample rate.

D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of
the 4 output channels has its own converter.

The price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface
board (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695. Rather
steep.

I think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good,
steadfast agnostics) in some high political offices.  When was the last
time we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don't
actually know; these aren't rhetorical questions.)  How 'bout some
Supreme court justices?  

One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news
program on a local station...The promo said something like "Who are
these cults, and why do they prey on the young?"  Ahem.  EVER HEAR OF
BAPTISM AT BIRTH?  If that isn't preying on the young, I don't know what
is...

I used to be (ack, barf) a Catholic, and was even confirmed...Shortly
thereafter I decided it was a load of BS.  My mom, who really insisted
that I continue to go to church, felt it was her duty (!) to bring me up
as a believer!  That was one of the more presumptuous things I've heard
in my life.  I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed.  The
priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn't
believe it, there was no good in forcing it on me.  Actually, I guess he
wasn't amazingly cool about it--His response is what you'd hope for
(indeed, expect) from a human being.  I s'pose I just _didn't_ expect
it...  

I find it absurd that religion exists; Yet, I can also see its
usefulness to people.  Facing up to the fact that you're just going to
be worm food in a few decades, and that there isn't some cosmic purpose
to humanity and the universe, can be pretty difficult for some people. 
Having a readily-available, pre-digested solution to this is pretty
attractive, if you're either a) gullible enough, b) willing to suspend
your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind, or c) have had the stuff
rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember.  Religion in
general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses; Organized
religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control.  

Blech.

As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager 
I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with 
the results.  The catalog description is as follows:

	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager 
	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a
	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two
	counter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits --
	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.

	Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109

To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or
fax at 1-800-345-4021.

********
NOTE:
When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price
was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog
enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  
QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,
and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it
looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the
first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a
reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to
ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could 
use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old 
one.  VERY reasonable people.
********

I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I 
would be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches 
and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  
If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough
time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, 
more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require 
physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit 
to get the prescription for p.t.  

The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache
(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my 
physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles 
in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the 
headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to 
while it is being massaged.

I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing
someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my 
neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in 
the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient 
p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up 
in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.

I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base
unit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on each
side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about 
1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbs 
are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more 
toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in 
either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side 
of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either
side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck
or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.

For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if 
laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or 
neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or
standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are
also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I 
don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works 
well for me.

For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager
behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or
not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  
If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches 
whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use 
than the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together 
(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and 
move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than 
nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are 
not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't 
pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this 
is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple 
considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.

Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion 
for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my
neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard
against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a
few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  
After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, 
the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  
I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the 
most vulnerable point for me.

It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,
although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at
a time) to really work it out.

I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I
cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had
it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also 
to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have
been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this 
was very timely  for me.

This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently
became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been
in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,
while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog
products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought
put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones
I've seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom".
I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no
big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, 
particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.

I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would 
like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory
behind them.  E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute
things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much
there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness
stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such
systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental
and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism,
because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants
and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants
that have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what 
is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi,
accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that
probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.

Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience.
Rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal
and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that 
people don't want to be associated with that sort of thing.

I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You
have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the
book, which I have raised in the past, in the "ISLAM: a clearer view"
thread as well as the root of the "Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]"
thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that
you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before,
if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and
respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of
course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a
number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book,
indicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger,
who subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book,
vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.

So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a)
the statements you made concerning the book in the "a clearer view"
posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements
of fact, for instance "Rushdie depicts the women of the most
respected family in all of Islam as whores"), and b) your claim (which
I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to
cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on
critical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by
responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a
particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding
passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view
that "TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims".  This
view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone
to take it seriously.

>I am trying very hard to be amicable and rational.  

And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my
honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated
(or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion
that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless
propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical
interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's
essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course,
you are more than welcome to do so.

Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus.  I believe it is
the best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800
upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????
  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal
clock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up
SCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.

First, let me offer you my condolences.  I've had kidney stones 4 times 
and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see 
a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the
only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones
are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it
out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she
absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.
Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed 
to make sure there is not a serious problem.

No, Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism, not treating the
electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. What he is saying is that
the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential
criminals.  This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who
defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides
that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal
then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not
conducive to a free society.

Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people
is an impropriety upon that person, regardless of what type of crime or
what chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice
system as a punishment for the offender and possibly, therefore, a deterrant
to future offenders. Mathew sees it, most probably, as a means of
rehabilitation for the offender. So he was being cynical at you, okay?

Jeff.

The problem is this:
After starting up my machine it gives a high pitched sound once at the desktop also it only does it when the mouse is up or a menu is not showing.

as if I click the mouse the noise goes away for the amount of time the mouse is down. also this problem only happens for about 5-10 minutes.

please let me know if you know what this is, it sounds like it is coming form the power supply.

Here is the story:
I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an
Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh
I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected
to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.

Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,
and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do
the trick.

Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that
there aren't going to be any.

Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers
to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...

thanks in advance.

 Ah, now here is the core question. Let me suggest a scenario.

 We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate
with humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your
own words) 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck,
makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.)
 Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a
revelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem
to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the
observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are
many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.

 Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent
a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly
nothing to this 'revelation' thing?

 Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the
claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?

 Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I
have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is
nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.
 Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held
accountable for such an honest mistake?

There turned out to be a very simple, conventional explanation for the

the object between the plates altering the field because of purely

There is eye dominance same as handedness (and usually for the

hi all,

IN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing
	  on SVGA graphics.

COMPLETE:
	I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular
graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)

Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.

Platform: 386/486 class machine.
	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics
		(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering
		 purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for
		 speed reason.)
         (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA
          cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)

What I'm looking for?
1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes
   on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.
   Presumably in assembly languagine.
	Yes, VERY FAST please.
2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.
   Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of
   text, else later.
   (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)
2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the 
   project.

Final remarks;-
non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.

	Any help is appreciated.

So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then.
And "given by god" refers to any action whereby a god
god causes or better effects something.
 
 
Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand
that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but
it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics
is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish
theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god
views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute
evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is
still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.

The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting
the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the
process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break
out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.

Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other
reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is
foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages
as an example for the content of the whole book.

No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of
the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue
with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows
you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo-
logic question) is proof of a theology used.

It is an important question in the light of what for instance the
passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection
between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of
it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has
one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write
other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one
can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but
that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has
the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it
ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other
message that is included as well?

If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people
to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills
children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that
children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?
 
 
And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important
in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it
can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions
with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way,
and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some
god.
 
One cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what
is good depends on the question.

His _heart_? This jerk doesn't have a heart, and it beats me why you're

Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same
direction.  (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  You can use
the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making
sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.

How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a 
set of points, edges and faces?   Say that you had a cube with all faces that 
have their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  What's the
best way to realize that face is "flipped", and should have it's points
re-ordered?   I thought I had a good way of telling this, but then realized
that the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise
order for a 2d polygon.  I'd like something for 3d data.

Any hints, tips, references would be appreciated.

  Another folk remedy receives the blessing of medical study.           
Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically    
reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.
  For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical    
Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from 
chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate
8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second 
6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    
women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection 
were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   
  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  
It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   
researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    
brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         
thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  
in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         
protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  
try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     
acidophilus in its contents.

  Candida (Monilia)                                                     
  This disease is usually caused by Candida albicans, a fungus that we  
all carry at one time or another. In some circumstances, though, the    
organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    
intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the 
disease is commonly called thrush.                                      
  Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control     
pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.   
Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve      
inflammation.                                                           
  Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood    
tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole.
There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals
leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in     
their intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic  
antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.

Hi all,
I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color
Graphical BBS that supports PC, Mac, Linux, and Amiga callers. 
Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of 
which hit this group about 2 weeks ago). 
Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find
that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being
PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full
commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)

Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there
is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7
But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.

Is there a color version of MGR for Linux? 
I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.

Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ?
I can't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing.

Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?

Thanks in advan

What if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did
the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am
truly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is 
little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is
not surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little
reference to nuclear power and contamination.

While your interpretation is a reasonable one, I see no reason to reject
the other out of hand.  The King Jimmy translation says "if there is no
further mischief."  This does not necessarily imply to the woman.  I know
if my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort, we
would feel that a life was truly taken, not simply a process halted.

  What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRoute/TCP made by
Compatable Systems ($1400).  This will allow you to connect your Localtalk
network (4 Macs) to your Ethernet network (NeXT and Ethernet Mac).  It will
route TCP/IP protocol between the two networks.  Software routers are also
available for less money, but I'm not sure if they work with TCP/IP.

	Greetings. I've been seeing the word "storage" mentioned

well folks, my mac plus finally gave up the ghost this weekend after
starting life as a 512k way back in 1985.  sooo, i'm in the market for a
new machine a bit sooner than i intended to be...

i'm looking into picking up a powerbook 160 or maybe 180 and have a bunch
of questions that (hopefully) somebody can answer:

* does anybody know any dirt on when the next round of powerbook
introductions are expected?  i'd heard the 185c was supposed to make an
appearence "this summer" but haven't heard anymore on it - and since i
don't have access to macleak, i was wondering if anybody out there had
more info...

* has anybody heard rumors about price drops to the powerbook line like the
ones the duo's just went through recently?

* what's the impression of the display on the 180?  i could probably swing
a 180 if i got the 80Mb disk rather than the 120, but i don't really have
a feel for how much "better" the display is (yea, it looks great in the
store, but is that all "wow" or is it really that good?).  could i solicit
some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth
taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize
this is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the
machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody
who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).

* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)

thanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i'll post a
summary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the
corner... :( )

I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their "arbitrary but
carefully chosen number" is neither.  Additionally, I find their
choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why
not just use the letters "TIFF"?

(And no, I don't think they should have bothered to support both word
orders either- and I've found that many TIFF readers actually
don't.)

It could be one of the leukodystrophies (not adrenal, only
boys get that).  Surely you've been to a university pediatric
neurology department.  If not that is the next step.  Biopsies
might help, especially if peripheral nerves are also affected.
There are so many of these diseases that would fit the symptoms
you gave that more can't be said at this time.

I agree with your surmise that it is an autosomal recessive.
If so, your normal children won't have to worry too much unless
they marry near relatives.  Most recessive genes are rare
except in inbred communities (e.g. Lithuanian Jews).

As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary
opening and closing of the path.

The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high
impedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic
impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers
the audio.

In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
impedance.

Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.

Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make before
break and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years.

Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.

A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
passing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varying
the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and
you have a mixer!

Lots of luck!

Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'm

agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation
can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.

Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough
caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,
the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be
realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.
Therefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common
inflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,
of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:

Completely out - never again - items:
	o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)
	o popcorn (same)
	o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins
	o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)

Discouraged greatly:
	o raw vegetables (too fibrous)
	o wheat and raw grain breads
	o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)
	o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)
	o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)
	o long grain and wild rice (husky)
	o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)
	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing

I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this
day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your
system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the
NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try
the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!
Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the
daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more
thoroughly - you're mileage may vary.

As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  But
this is the info I've been given, and it may be a starting point for
discussion.  Good luck!

I had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back.  The needles were taken
from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly NOT
sterile or even clean for that matter.  More than likely they were fresh
from the previous patient.  I WAS concerned, but I kept my mouth shut.  I

I'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system.

What I would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for
their quality and performance.

My preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both 800k and
1.4k floppies, but handling 800k floppies is not a necessity.

So far, I only know a bit about the Iomega floptical and the Infinity
floptical drives.  Are there any comments/recommendations for either of these?

Are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where
can they be purchased (i.e. which mail order places, etc).

Thanks in advance.

GEC/Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators (SL1454 etc) for use in
satellite TV receivers : 150 or 600MHz in, 10MHz of baseband video out.
I think there's also a related data slicer / clock recovery circuit intended
for use in DMAC decoders, though that isn't used in the most common 
implementation - it may not be in volume production.

The most easily available components probably vary with local satellite
standards, and I think the european systems vary rather widely from those
in the US - so it may be worth investigating locally-available receiver
designs to find out what's in common use.

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

Hope this helps.

Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for

This requires the same total exposure time, and the same precision in

MSG is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. If it is
pure, the source should not be a problem. Your comment suggests that 
impurities may be the cause.
My experience of MSG effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the
pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.

Anyone who dies for a "cause" runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As for
people being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters and
charlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield had
been the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  
Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't the
first to be "witnessed."  What sets him apart?

Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and

Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.
Koresh is a non-issue.

Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something is
written in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus
the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you
do quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with 
supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.

Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you 
define the world "total," but I would imagine a "total sacrafice [sp]

You are correct about our tendency to "box everything into time units."

Good for her.  What we don't need is everyone suing community service
agencies that provide blood that people need.  Testing is not fool proof.
The fact that he got AIDS from a transfusion (if he really did) does
not mean the Red Cross screwed up.  Prior to 1983 or so, there wasn't
a good test and a lot of bad blood got through.  This wasn't the fault
of the Red Cross.  When did he get the transfusions?

 Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on

was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsided
in an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to

for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A friend

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not
the result of the natural process of evolution (but rather an "act of God")
and then in the same post say that these other processes (volcanos et al.)
are natural occurrences.  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are
natural processes and what are direct acts of God?  How do you know that
God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose
in mind?  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in
the bible.

Adam & Eve (TWO PEOPLE), even tho they had the honor (or so you christians
claim) of being the first two, definitely do NOT represent a majority in
the billions and trillions (probably more) of people that have come after
them.  Perhaps they were the majority then, but *I* (and YOU) weren't
around to vote, and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to
do with that tree.  But your god never asked us.  He just assumes that if
you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad.  Hmm.  Sounds like the
same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting
here resorting to.  So THAT's where they get it... shoulda known.

An endorsement, or an acknowledgement?  I think gods are things that people

A professor of mine once said "The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about $5000" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than
the CS.
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the "computer" in your
car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE. 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.

P.S. The $5000 is not just a joke

A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post
the following information.

A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting
to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would
just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).  
It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the
size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two
more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's
described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual
cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been
extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake
up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day
it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5
very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that
knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.

She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason
for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected
thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything
came back normal.  

She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any
ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should
see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?

** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently
taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't
recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, 
coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall
out.

Thanks in advance for any help!

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries
(you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost
one.

                               Books -- Fiction

THOMAS M. DISCH

"The Santa Claus Compromise"
Short story.  The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and 
events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...

WALTER M. MILLER, JR

"A Canticle for Leibowitz"
One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives
copying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper with
ink and leaving white lines and letters.

EDGAR PANGBORN

"Davy"
Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,
forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing...
atoms". 

PHILIP K. DICK

Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short 
stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he
remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:

"Galactic Pot-Healer"
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.

"A Maze of Death"
Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.

"VALIS"
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

"The Divine Invasion"
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.

MARGARET ATWOOD

"The Handmaid's Tale"
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are
hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

VARIOUS AUTHORS

"The Bible"
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

PETER DE ROSA

"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988
Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very
enlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.
(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums",
Droemer-Knaur, 1989)

MICHAEL MARTIN

"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press,
 Philadelphia, USA.
A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area.  Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in the
existence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)").  Includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.
541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)

"The Case Against Christianity", Temple University Press
A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)
demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent.
273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5

JAMES TURNER

"Without God, Without Creed", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,
 MD, USA
Subtitled "The Origins of Unbelief in America".  Examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative
world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France
and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England
developments.  "Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,
Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea, the belief that God exists." 
316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4

GEORGE SELDES (Editor)

"The great thoughts", Ballantine Books, New York, USA
A "dictionary of quotations" of a different kind, concentrating on statements
and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy
and world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many
people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various
people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of
the quotations are derived from Cardiff's "What Great Men Think of Religion"
and Noyes' "Views of Religion".
490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.

RICHARD SWINBURNE

"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence of
Theism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In this
work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised
edition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.

J. L. MACKIE

"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford
This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through
the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for
God" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.

Benchmarks are for marketing dweebs and CPU envy.  OK, if it will make

The point being the processor speed is only one of many aspects of a
computers performance.  Clock speed, processor, memory speed, CPU
architecture, I/O systems, even the application program all contribute 
to the overall system performance.

I'm looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good low-noise characteristics,  large clean gain, and incorportates phantom power (20-48 volts (dc)) for a PZM microphone.  I'm leaning towards a good, low-cost (??) instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone, for its good CMRR, internal compensation, and because i can use a minimal # of parts.  

Does anyone out there have any experience, suggestions, advice, etc...that they'd like to pass on, I'd greatly appreciate it.

With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and
so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:

1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns
VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)

2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing
would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic
board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)

Just wondering....

Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d
plane formed by the lines.  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in
2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which
won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines
from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This
bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.

Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!

The mass of anectdotal evidence, combined with the lack of

Definately, I agree wholeheartedly.  If they can build the amp where

Sure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the
  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to
  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.
I don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing :)
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below
  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.

My opinions once again.

Does this also affect the viewing of tapes ? I have had problems with

What is happening is this:
1) You turn the TV on.
2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

Things to check:
First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

Well, certainly in Archimedes case the description "while observing the

	---this file last updated..4-21-93---


WHAT IS OTIS?

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    
and distribution.  Digital immortality.

The basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different
formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be
there...and someone will dig them up.  
 
If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is 
breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.
 
Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own
copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...
that's what they're here for.

---------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE?             

OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  
 
 	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site
		
	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 
	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)

Merely "anonymous FTP" to either site on Internet and change to the
appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the "bin"
command to make sure you're in binary.

OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North
America....the following systems have a substancial supply of
OTIStuff...
	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines
	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron

--------------------------------------------------------------
 
HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?
              
What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put
it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me
(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,
it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works
are also welcome.

OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  
GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to 
see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit
tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  
you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    
JPG files to a standard GIF format. 

OTIS also accepts animation files.      

When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people
to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll
be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You 
can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of 
emailing).

If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send
copies to:

The OTIS Project
c/o Ed Stastny
PO BX 241113
Omaha, NE 68124-1113

I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  
Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named, include those as well.  
 
Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please
contact me and we'll arrange things.

If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5"
disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.
This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,
but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM
compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or
JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather
not have to.

At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they
can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send
a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to 
get a slab-o-OTIS.

As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  
Email me for current archive size and directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTION?

The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to
another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images.  
 
It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images
from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.

It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as
possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite
BBS system....or even just post this "info-file" there.  It would be
keen of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

USE?

If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,
you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or
full address credit).  You will either find this in the ".rm" file for    
the image or series of images...or in the "Artists" directory under the 
Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email
me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for 
you, or give you their contact information.
 
When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist
know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

NAMING IMAGES?

Please keep the names of your files in "dos" format.  That means, keep
the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way
I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or
four digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number.
Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like:
 
	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC

Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems.  


---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CREATING IMAGE FILES?

When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in
case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,
address or other information you'd like people to know.

 I know this is a little weird, but I know that World magazine (you know,
National Geo. for children) did a very simple and concise article on Kirlian
photography.  They had some neat pictures, too.  A friend of mine's mother had
a book on Kirlian photography, only it's photographs took a radiologist to 
interpret.  They (World magazine) warned us all that it was very dangerous,
probably to stop curious children from experimenting with it.  Mind you, this
was 10 years ago, at least.  (And boy, does that say something about my age)

 Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but
in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use
that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because
long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.

Subject: 3DS: Where did all the texture rules go?
Lines: 21

Hi,

I've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes
positioned carefully) to a .3DS file that when you reload it after restarting
3DS, they are given a default position and orientation.  But if you save
to a .PRJ file their positions/orientation are preserved.  Does anyone
know why this information is not stored in the .3DS file?  Nothing is
explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the .PRJ file. 
I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have 
the format for the .PRJ file?

Is the .CEL file format available from somewhere?

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings "near UV light" /is/ "actual UV light."  The "near" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is "nearly UV."  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
"far UV" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.

The best info I have seen so far is the article "Joystick Metrics:
Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port" by
Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in
BASIC, and even includes code for a simple "oscilloscope" display.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,
etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

  If your science teacher tells you glass is a liquid, try to get a different

This is a classic example of excessive faith in reason.  The fact that we

simply implies that it is hard to talk about.  There is a very good chance

   What do I need to do to be able to run an NEC 3FGx in 800x 600 mode
on my IIci?  Can it be done with the right video card?  If so, which
video card?

Subject: Need to find out number to a phone line
Lines: 13


Greetings!
      
        Situation:  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall.  I don't
                    know the number of the line.  And I don't want
                    to call up the operator to place a trace on it.

        Question:   Is there a certain device out there that I can
                    use to find out the number to the line?
        Thanks for any response.

Hi,

I'm in the market for an internal color video adaptor for my PB 145.  I
was wondering if anyone has used the PowerVision adaptor made by
Mirror.  If so, can you tell me how feel about the speed and
compatability of it?  I might also be interested in other boards by
Envisio etc., so if you have such a board please e-mail your opinion of
it.  Thanks in advance.

{Send follow ups to comp.sys.mac.advocacy. Sorry about the header but the 
Pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and I gave up after a

Mac & IBM Info-Version 1.7.7

The reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the 
information out there, so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate 
about what they are saying about their machines.  Since computer technology 
is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will 
be lacking or incorrect on information.  So, please just don't say the sheet 
is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to 
make the needed corrections.  All prices are in US dollars.
To keep this data sheet organized please provide, if possible, article 
citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to 
a minimum.  As this is a general data sheet, keep the info provided simple so 
I can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others. 
Finally, keep the information relevant to the section corrected {For example, 
OS code in ROM is software contained in hardware, so no more of the 'but it 
is supported in OS disk software' data for the hardware section, please}. 
Thank you.

The CPUs
 Note: I am only showing Motorola & Intel CPUs used in Mac and most IBM/PC 
clone machines. For example, since Apple never used the Motorola 68008 and 
68010 in the Mac these chips are not listed. Years only appear with dead CPUs 
and indicate first to last year used as a CPU.
Cache note:  both IBM and Mac use caches external to the CPUs. These external 
caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of it.  In most of 
the present Macs there are external caches built-in while with IBM they are 
optional {Though machines are generally sold with them installed}.  Since 
there are many different external caches {CPU-Mac and IBM; SCSI, video, disk 
and static RAM-Mac}, each having a different effect on CPU performance, and 
they are machine {32KB static RAM cache in IIci, IIfx, and IIvx}, seller 
{cache card installed in some IIcis} or expansion {IIci cache cards go up to 
128KB} dependent, I have decided to leave them out of the list.
Note:  ALU is industry's de-facto standard for CPU bit classification.

486sx in 386sx socket with 1k cache and improved integer math speed.  IBM: 
equivalent to the 486sx except it has a 16k on-chip cache.

**68000 Mac designs created a 4MB limit.
***The 040 has 2 clocks, an internal processor clock [PCLK] that is 2x freq of 
external bus clock [BCLK] which is the one used to rate the chips 
(Bradley Lamont; Motorola 68040 data book).  Some compilers produce programs 
sensitive to the PCLK and so they act as if the 68040 was a clock doubler 
chip, but this very compiler and program dependent.  Compliers maybe written 
to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040's PCLK in the 
future.  As it is now, studies such as one in a Byte article {which showed 
040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, OS, 
and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance.
*#Motorola claims (PC Week 09/07/92; 09/14/92).

As the PowerPCs are to be in both IBM and Mac machines I have listed them 
separately to eliminate redundancy.  They are Motorola CPU RISC chips.

CPUs Comparison List
As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the 
same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at 
higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th 
ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020 
and above.

<=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address 
lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it 
down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}

286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips 
come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The 
hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X. 
The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between 
the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the 
286 ~ 68020 comparison.}

386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0 
is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for 
apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the 
Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.  
The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them 
comparative to 386sxs.}

486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost 
solution for people who do not need the FPU.  Only with programs sensitive to  
PCLK & pipelining does the 68LC040 behave like 486dx2 - FPU or a '486dx2sx'.}

486     ~ 68040 {two 32-bit microprocessors with built-in FPU, MMU, 8K 
internal cache (which is implemented as two 4K caches in the 68040 and one in 
the 486).  Only with programs sensitive to PCLK & pipelining does the 68040 
behave like a 486dx2.}

Pentium   ~ 68060 {Both are planned to be superscalar but both have heat 
problems.  These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93; 
4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek 
12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium
(PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.} 

PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS, 
Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later 
Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in 
a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}

Hardware 
{In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you 
add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating 
systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software 
developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).}
Color Support/Display
 Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of 
32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw 
allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-
bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y 
independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 
dpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including 
autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz 
vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser 
Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and 
IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit 
color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  
To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display 
capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit 
color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX 
will change this.
In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one 
monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same 
thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree 
of overlap of the pictures.
VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of 
 built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit
 color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. 
Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became 
 standard with the SE/30.

IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system 
interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing 
BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation
of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program 
interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer 
Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a 
standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is 
actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like 
Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, 
especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present 
things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver 
and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, 
and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with 
an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 
486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 
and still have ALL the colors one started out with}.
Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster 
processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD 
ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  
MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter
 original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.
CGA: Color Graphics Array
 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.
EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array
 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions 
 could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.
VGA:  Video Graphics Array*
 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are 
 the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a 
 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock
 (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals
 from EGA/CGA etc. 
MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*
 subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA 
 and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  
 Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.
SVGA:  Super VGA*
 This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch 
 all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer 
 using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating
 as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a 
 standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things
 are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution
 of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since 
 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, 
 some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually 
 at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital 
 Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], 
 some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting 
 factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: 
 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a 
 64K "window", etc.
Other non-SVGA standards: 
8514/a:
 IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions 
 like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations 
 from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do 
 not have interlacing. 
TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some
 do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.
XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array
 newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones 
 are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at 
 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.
XGA-2
 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in
 Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area
 fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-
 exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be 
 far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth 
 isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other 
 companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh 
 rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual 
 discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.
*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.

Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software
 drivers.  "Fast SCSI-1" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode
 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast
 SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  
 hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are
 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and
 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can
 use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such
 is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast SCSI-1". 
 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics
 but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a
 different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which
 makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.
Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though 
 Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager
 needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI
 interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast 
 asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2
 controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) 
 though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port 
 interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus 
 Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some
 Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard 
 and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.
IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with 
 systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.
 Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers
 out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications
 which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.

Mac
Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin 
 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs
 could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity 
 feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx 
 used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new 
 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.
 The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every
 memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will
 not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.
 Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs 
 had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris 
 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that 
 allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same 
 size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting 
 in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).
Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.
Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. 
PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, 
 Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  
 Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: 
 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with
 the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in 
 IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows 
 through put down.
NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,
 and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:
 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and 
 Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a 
 Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet 
 to DMA.
NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:
 ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7" instead of the 
 old 12".
QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's 
 VLBus - "Architecture is identical to that of VLBus" (Byte 10/92:128).
 Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.
CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  
 Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at 
 the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to 
 dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each 
 NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with 
 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.

IBM
Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-
like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.

HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: 
MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited
 only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics 
 Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.
 currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives. Can have more than one hard drive. 
ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface
 ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in
 many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of
 hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. 

BUS interfaces
{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working 
with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}
ISA
 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a
 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).
 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,
 hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards
 aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}
 while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's
 showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit
 (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  
MCA {Micro Channel}
 IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one CPU in a computer" 
 (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components 
 involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA 
 and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).
EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}
 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to 
 self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable 
 interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.
VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}
 Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}
 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus 
 mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for 
 video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of
 their patents (Mel Martinez).
QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture
 (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines
 (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.
PCI
 Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace 
 ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.

OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]
and multiple application use.}
Mac
512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows 
Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, 
menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require 
clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires 
access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM 
chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support 
interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS 
has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and 
therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control 
over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with 
some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a 
totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon 
Wtte).
6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, 
 cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  
 Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program 
 interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of 
 AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a 
 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as 
 real RAM is below 8MB.
6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.
6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.
7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard 
 to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present 
 non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on
 system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking 
 within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing 
 can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be 
 accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, 
 Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable 
 IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType 
 support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present 
 machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is 
 both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit 
 mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last 
 'free' OS.
7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than 
 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode 
 on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. 
 Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades
 {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.
 [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system 
 fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any 
 RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all 
 fonts from the system file.]
A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and 
 a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS 
 is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac 
 ROMs.  Price: $709.
Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats 
including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and 
DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' 
and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most 
still play.

IBM
 Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for 
programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  
Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, 
what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  
This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or 
EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to 
better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which 
is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it 
reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware 
support is needed.
Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing 
all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing 
its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 ("Undocumented Windows") and 
"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to 
abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 
#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC 
judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no 
action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of 
choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has 
turned down Microsoft's copyright of "Windows" which would allow it to charge 
a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).
MicroSoft OSes
DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier 
 with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program 
 must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS 
 Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit 
 Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in
 DOS 4.0.
DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk 
 defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for 
 networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} 
 (Byte April 1993:44-46).
DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).
Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to 
 deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to
 run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the
 equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].
 This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac
 programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and
 still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed
 is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).
 Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS
 counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).
Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base 
 requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. 
 Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).
Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  
 Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 
 with built-in peer to peer networking support.
Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the 
 swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in 
 the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the 
 reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM 
 but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).
 This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric 
 multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in
 networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even
 though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor
 is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993
 (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993
 (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495
 (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).
Other OSes
PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS 
 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).
DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} 
 and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later 
 version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple 
 file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).
OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,
 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, 
 multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file 
 to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. 
 IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this 
 (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).
AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.
NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final 
 version to be out by May 25, 1993.
Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric 
 multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with 
 tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and 
 communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users
 server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.
Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel 
 Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM 
 (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run 
 on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps 
 will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to 
 Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow 
 progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in 
 late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}

PowerPC
Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; 
MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA 
video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week 
3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.
Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and 
to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to 
sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser 
9/92:146)}
(MacWeek 3/22/93).
PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on
 PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain
 (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard
 drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.
 Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.
Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) 
 and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and 
 PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).
Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.
Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the
 Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state 
 that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details
NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.

OS Number Crunching (Mel Park)
Mac
 Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard 
Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an 
FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or 
taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are 
handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal 
representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment 
of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and 
the FPU programmed directly.

IBM
 Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when 
emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers 
exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS 
prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this 
better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, 
Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.

Networking [Includes printing]
WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially 
if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.
Mac
Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  
LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for 
each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to 
include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in 
Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at 
about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and 
transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.
The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet 
interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a 
network option since 1989.
Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can 
use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS 
as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, 
Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing 
machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows 
typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version 
will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 
(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC 
Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software 
built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. 
Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.
Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.
 {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}

IBM  
Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.
Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk 
protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.
Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible 
with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to 
that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more 
forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, 
{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and 
offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more 
complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac 
finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  
InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)
Printing {Very OS dependent}
DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, 
 and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
 software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly 
 implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one 
 software program to the next.
Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs" 
 in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they 
 are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
 on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine 
 which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like 
 and intelligent about this.
OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.
Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do 
not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and 
not that of the OS involved.

Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features 
than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars 
by both worlds.
The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to 
handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac 
hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  
built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and 
NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs 
which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.
 Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.
All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where 
noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card

monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, 
sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to 
16-bit color, etc}.
Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz

  Does anyone have some information on the relative fraction of the final
cost of each component in an average hard drive?  For instance, I'm pretty
sure the heads and the platters are the most expensive parts, with the
assembly costs running a close third.  Cost of the electronics is likely
in the noise.
  Any hard numbers ($$ or percentage)?  Thanks.

I have a spare Fluke 8062A.  This is a true RMS digital meter with

works fine - which is what Fluke's are all about.   BTW - according
to the fellow who designed these meters, they can be converted to 8060A
function by clipping a jumper, and adding the 2 extra switches..
Like I said $115 seems fair - these sell for $300+ new.

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some
claim their heart "skipped" beats once in a while. Some reacted with
headache, some stomach ache. Some had watery eyes or running nose, some
had itchy skin or rashes. More serious accusations include respiration 
difficulty and brain damage. 

Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning. But
if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.

I agree. Adding layers of managers and bureaucrats simply eat up
money that could be spent on those who actually are doing the work
such as doctors and nurse, and supplies.  The most efficient system
is probably one that has limited management and a fixed budget such
as England's or even Canada's.  I'm afraid we are on the wrong
track.  The problem may be that the insurance lobby is too powerful.

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions
is called _Man's Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a class
I had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent
bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.

It doesn't "compare" religions directly but describes each one individually
and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even
remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity
mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is
divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began 
(India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions
from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each
other over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along
the way.  

If you like the old stuff, then a couple of books called "The Ancient Near
East" by James B. Pritchard are pretty cool.  Got the Epic of Gilgamesh,
Code of Hammurabi, all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods
were men.  Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their own
religion and make it sound real good.

I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's
"MacTools Backup" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x. 
The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect
relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than 
might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.  

Used Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less
economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools 
is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.

Retrospect is nice, though, and I'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0.

Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.
The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were
VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest
problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.

In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets
with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you
can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they
were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory
periodically.

With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be
less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer
recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their
equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find
that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it
should be o.k. for most applications.

Maybe I should point out that we are not talking about c.s.amiga.*.

I have a stereo compressor-limiter by 
Audio Logic (Model MT-66).  The gates work,
but the compressor seems to be gone on one
channel, and very weak on the other.  

I'll probably need an ocsilloscope to trace it
down (no pun intended), but if any one with
experience with this type of equipment could
point me in a certain direction as to where the 
circuit is most likely to fail, I'd sure appreciate it.

                    Alt.Atheism Frequently-Asked Questions

This file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in
alt.atheism.  Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the
"Introduction to Atheism"; you are advised to read that article as well
before posting.

These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of
the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If
you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't
covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.

Subject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?

Typical posting:

Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?  
What is there to discuss?

Response:

Many things are discussed here, including:

* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's
  family
* Prayer in schools
* Discrimination against atheists
* Sunday trading laws
* The Satanic Child Abuse myth
* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'
* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students
* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers
* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual
* Why people become atheists

Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians
looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't 
want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure 
from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.

------------------------------

Subject: Hitler was an atheist!

Typical posting:

Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!

Response:

Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:

   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in
   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_
   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_
   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]

   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their
   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the
   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be
   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every
   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who
   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his
   religious community and tries to butt into the other.

   [...]

   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will
   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_
   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]

          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.

Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief
wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed 
to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, 
though.

------------------------------

Subject: The Bible proves it

Typical posting:

In the Bible it says that...

Response:

Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable
accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were
recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed
'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The
Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being
accepted.

Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is
subject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and
one thing only is not legitimate.

Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.

It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other
equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.

------------------------------

Subject: Pascal's Wager

Typical posting:

If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --
but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to
hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.

Response:

This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.

Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are
many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often
described as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is a
follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.

Secondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to be
incorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in
the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.
Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in
favour of prayer.

Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that 
the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of 
comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God 
is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the
argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.

Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on 
evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or 
cost-benefit analysis.

Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:

  1. One does not know whether God exists.
  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does
     exist.
  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.
  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.

There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an
assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in
the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is
considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no
information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates
information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at
no "cost".

The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The
problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the
Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The
argument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your interests
to believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal
intended the argument to be viewed.

The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is
omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as
a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all
whether people believe in him.

------------------------------

Subject: What is Occam's Razor?

Typical posting:

People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?

Response:

William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's 
Razor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities 
unnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposing
the existence of some entity, then do so.

Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it 
more generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".

The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations 
for what we see around us:

1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which
came into being as a result of natural processes.

2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and 
there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be 
of non-zero complexity.

Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest 
that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.
Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:

3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  
We just imagine that there is.

This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people 
find unacceptable.
 
------------------------------

Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus

Typical posting:

I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.

Response:

Preaching is not appreciated.

Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that
are on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and
will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup
talk.religion.misc).

You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite
newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would
have them do unto you!

Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy
analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the
basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell
atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,
since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.

------------------------------

Subject: Why I know that God exists

Typical posting:

I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.

Response:

Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship
exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not
exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.

Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many
people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been
abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.

------------------------------

Subject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"

Typical posting:

Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?

Response:

Einstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". 
This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the
Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's
refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,
Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.

A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:
"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of
what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of
human beings."

Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an
objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random
events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that
QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for
statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,
and much evidence suggests that it never will be.

A longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A
Symposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion
in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In
it he says:

  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events
   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side
   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him
   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an
   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a
   personal God interfering with natural events could never be
   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this
   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific
   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.

   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives
   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine
   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,
   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm
   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers
   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal
   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past
   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they
   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable
   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity
   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably
   more worthy task..."

Einstein has also said:

  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,
   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a
   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.
   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the
   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our
   science can reveal it."

The latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen 
Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  
Also from the same book:

  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics
   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind 
   it."

Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does 
not in itself imply that Christianity is false.

------------------------------

Subject: Everyone worships something

Typical posting:

Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.

Response:

If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about
those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for
example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.

------------------------------

Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause

Typical posting:

Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so
chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.

Response:

The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has
no smallest member.

Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does
not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and
especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by
any particular religion.

------------------------------

Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed

Typical posting:

The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you
don't think all this appeared here just by chance?

Response:

This is known as the Argument From Design.

It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the
universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living
creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the
newsgroup talk.origins for a while.

There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.
However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of
so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,
observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the
universe and life on earth.

The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of
something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that
surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some 
external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos
deliberately.

But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind
capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must
be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the
existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist
position.

This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,
what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling 
improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not
created and just "is" (or "was").

From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe
just "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book
"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closed
and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.

The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called 
Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on
the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it
evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the 
watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the 
universe too must have a creator.

The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above 
those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates 
watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have 
created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are 
clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.

Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in 
the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear 
reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument 
would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a 
different part of creation.

Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that 
the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore 
stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the 
argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not 
random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus 
internally inconsistent.

------------------------------

Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true

Typical posting:

The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary
evidence.  For example...

Response:

The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary
evidence.

Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or
James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many
scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but
that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" of
the original text have been published to this effect.

Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320
C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate
falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the
first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is
generally given the title of authorship for this material.

Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is
more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently
Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.

------------------------------

Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

Typical posting:

Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the
Bible to be both true and complete.

Response:

Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal 
system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary 
arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be 
valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically
speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision
procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal 
system.)

Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar 
Paradox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This 
sentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal 
system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.

The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims
that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to
prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.

One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the
existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. 
This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.

It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms
that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show
that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that
would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists
within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about
whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.

Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about
the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.

Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates
that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be
both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal
systems, so such claims are nonsense.

------------------------------

Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism

Typical posting:

Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?

Response:

The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.
Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman
is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of
the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce
federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the
presidential primary:

 RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?"

 GB: "I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in
      God is important to me."

 RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of
      Americans who are atheists?"

 GB: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,
      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under
      God."

 RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation
      of state and church?"

 GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not
      very high on atheists."

UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were
still angry over the remarks.

The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,
1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,
Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.

On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,
cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a
lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School
District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"
(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:
 
 RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.
      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"
 
 EM: "It's bullshit."
 
 RS: "What is bullshit?"
 
 EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."
 
 RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush
      campaign is on this issue."

 EM: "You're welcome."

After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract
his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the
President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by
his original statement, and wrote:

  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports
   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or
   supported by the government."

Atheist Press's Cameron Road address.

------------------------------

Subject: I know where hell is!

Typical posting:

I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!

Response:

There are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around the
world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly
amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now 
getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.

------------------------------

Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted

Typical posting:

Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?

Response:
 
American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical
contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for
details.

There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the
archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.

------------------------------

Subject: The USA is a Christian nation

Typical posting:

Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the
United States be considered a Christian nation?

Response:

Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear
that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some
quotes; there are many more.

  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?
   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the
   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen
   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been
   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert
   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient
   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,
   needs them not."
      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785

  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of
   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.
   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"
      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson

  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people
   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of
   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will
   always avail themselves for their own purpose."

      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813

  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or
   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely
   above it."

      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",
        Nov. 20, 1728

------------------------------

Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation

Typical posting:

Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any
sense founded upon the Christian religion?

Response:

No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty
of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):

   Article 11

   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense
   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of
   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as

The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections
such as Charles Bevans' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of the
United States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).

The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on
June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was
recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the
quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.

The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul
General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of
Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there
is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.

In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the
quotation.

This rumor didn't happen to appear on April 1st?

If this DigiKey rep was serious, I think I will buy my parts elsewhere.

     If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.
You simply use GLIB to extract the image (each "frame" in a .GL is
actually a complete .PCX or .CLP file), then use one of MANY available
utilities to convert it.  If you don't have the GRASP package, I'm afraid
I can't help you.  Sorry.
     By the way, before you ask, GRASP (GRaphics Animation System for
Professionals) is a commercial product that sells for just over US$300
from most mail-order companies I've seen.  And no, I don't have it.  :)

For your information:

I hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the C-Itoh
8510 driver in Windows 3.1.  The cable I am using is a straight-thru
cable connected to a Null Modem Adapter I got at Radio Shack (catalog
#26-1496a) for $4.95.  It seems to work fine with both DOS and Windows.
I used the following command in DOS

	C:\DOS\mode COM1:9600,n,8,1,p

and set up the port the same way in the Windows Ports setup.

the Null Modem connections are as follows:

	1	to	1
	2	to	3
	3	to	2
	4	to	5
	5	to	4
	6+8	to	20
	20	to	6+8
	7	to	7

I printed from several applications and all seems OK.

Do you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and
has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour
of this statement, shouldn't we?

Perhaps the biggest "imperfection" of the code is that it is full
of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they
intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is
likely that early exons represented early protein domains.

Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that
intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually
have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. 

On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted
later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed
by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,
if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have
required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,
since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are
conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a
trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and
these are not found in or near intron sequences. 

I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and
genetics before posting "theological arguments" like this. 
Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish
& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.

: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does
: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a

: scientific perspective, just different.

Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas 
theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.
 
: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,
: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.

For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support
your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific
perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.

In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps
more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might
have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by
computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) 
 
: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma
: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.

In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although
it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. 

: Actually, neither of us "knows" what the atmosphere was like at the

I'd replace "created" with "formed", since there is no need to 
invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.
Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8
billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but
organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.
This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to
evolve.

I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course
on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.

Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for
this supposed "degeneration"? 

I can understand Scott's reaction:

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests 
everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against
this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in 
anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the 
right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,
and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. 

Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt
it could ever come to right conclusions.

You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses
do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of
a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators
from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to 
survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it 
to the present. 

And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that
human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have
claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,
and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either
claim.

Of course, nothing "evil" is god's fault.  But your explanation does

He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,
it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are
just as inevitable as any product of evolution.

: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic

I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.
I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed
free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer
is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.

What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?
  
: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)

A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.

Why is there a "why behind"? And your proposition was something
that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend
these books.

Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence
for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without

suggest, why do people still insist on this?

      One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that
without bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup.
It almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to
tear apart. Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wanted
write about.

      How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If you
want to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there? Seriously,
the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each
other. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next
it says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow a
deity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one they
invented.

      For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not to
EVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn't god
say not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don't you think
that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?

Was Jesus illiterate? Why didn't he write anything? Anyone know?

      I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that
it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the
poorer quality ones to boot. The only reason xtianity escaped the middle east
is because a certain roman who's wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome
xtian after a bad dream.

      If this posting keeps one person, just ONE person, from standing on a

       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the
way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,
rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about "thermal 
pollution" de-icing a river, said, "Up here, we view heat as a resource".  

       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is 
purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.

Hismanal (astemizole) is most definitely linked to weight gain.
It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect,
and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly

Yes I fully agree with that, but is it "I don't believe gods exist", or
"I believe no gods exist"? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)
pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word "believe" to mean.

Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak
atheism, at least according to the FAQ:

# Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.
# Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is
# often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong
# atheism".
# 
# It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak
# atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong
# atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not
# fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".

(From mathew's "An Introduction to Atheism" version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93)

Should the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of "belief"?
Can it?

How many NuBus slots do you have?

Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is
a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms
toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with
software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they
think they open a built-in port.

They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance)
and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles
8 ports simultaneously.

As I said, with NuBus, you're green. Learn how to use the Comms
Resource Manager to get at the various installed cards.

The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it
at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above
the minimally guaranteed figure.

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768.            Like most things, you get what you pay.  That's the deal.

Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

good luck,

aaron

The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity
statements, since the "is" in those statements is the "is" of predication
rather than of identity.  Instead, they should be translated using a
predicate letter.  Using "g" to designate God and "j" to designate Jesus,
and the predicate letter "E" for the property of being eternal, the
first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej.
    The second premise appears to contain an "is" of identity, in which
case it can be properly symbolized as j = g.  But your remark that "Jesus
is a subset of God" suggests that strict identity is not desired here.
If, however, the first premise means that all members making up the set
God have the property of being eternal, the same conclusion follows.

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.
If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per
channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish.

Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced.

A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.
Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location.

I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is
supposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data
transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is
available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two
mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since
I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The
CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,
which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the
CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly
lower price with two free CDs.

The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I
think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the
three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple
catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo
cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of
which are pretty good.

The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and
a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around
$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible
before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of
the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's
unless you buy it in a bundle.

Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the
Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's
compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's
speed and performance. 

BTW, the models of the drives are:

Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)

CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it
is also something like with 3401)

NEC:  CDR-74


I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems
whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am
pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.

Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as
the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,
my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is
just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the
enormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has
three Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and
lives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.

Hi,

The subject line says it all.  My system acts weird at times.  All of a
sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.

This was a really big problem for a while.  I couldn't even format my
drive properly.  I installed HDT's driver and things got better.  Now
all I have to do is reinstall the system.  Could an incompatibility 
exist between it and a Quantum external drive.

I'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  It's not a virus, bad
software, etc.  Could I have a bad SCSI cable?  Or is the IBM (WDS-80)
just a screwey drive?

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties
with Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority of
people, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though
90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland,
religious people are actually a minority. 

Could it be possible that many people believe in god "just in case"?
It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's
Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe
reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes,
but doesn't know what or how. 

People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,
they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say
that they are not "born in the Spirit", but this does not disturb them.
Religion is not something to think about. 

I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible
dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - 
a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.
Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our
morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many
people take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow
(and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )

However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears
some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics
works? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that
perhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics. 

Is usefulness any criterion?

The yearly chest x-ray provides a minute amount of radiation.  It is

It appears as if the problem is related to the 68882/50's need for very fast
(and clean) signal transitions.  I got some email (Vielen Dank, Thomas) stating
that Motorola provides a solution for this problem in their 68030 manual.  
Since my manual (1989) predates the 50 MHz 68030/68882s I couldn't find it.
Could someone please email me the specifics?

    What phony names? My name is clearly visible in the headers, and I
sing the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that,
then you will have to get over it. I've used this account name for over
10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7

    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except
for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you
about the LW Pro design.

    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy
it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no
longer valid.

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB
SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily
available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just
fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are
generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.

The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset
of the 68851's functions.  If you look underneath your front left floppy
bay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size.  One will
be the 68020, the next the 68881, and the third, approximately the same
size, will be the Apple chip.  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump'
in the middle of it.


Example:


                         -----------
                        /           \
         ---------------             ---------------
         |                                         |
         |                                         |

That and the Apple logo should make it easy to find.

Subject: converting keyboard for mac plus
Organization: Illinois State University

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.
It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with
a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you
very much).
 
well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .

Hi Adda,

Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain
time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works
from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.

There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the
mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters,
etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of
the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout
this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who
quoted various scriptures in their writings.

> 2.  Is there any truth in my acquaintance's statements?

If you mean that someone discovered thousands of "Bibles" which were all
perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!

If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the
dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable
text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest
original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime
shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.

> 3.  From who/where did the bible originate?

From the original authors.  We call them Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter,
Paul, James, and one other not identified.

At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not 
mistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel.  Like I said, the Prince of 
Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre.  He was a wicked man.  By calling Satan 
the King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre.

Don't think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one, 
although most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as 
being a reference to Satan. (I haven't read Ezekiel throughly in a long 
time.)

Are there any books or application notes on this subject available?

Shure it is temperature dependent, but this does not clean all your
problems.
Based on some exp. I must say that the connections between the power supply
and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be
badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the
last
phase (lower Voltage).

So you can do following if you are used to such technical terms.
1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray
2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply
3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowinÔ through the floppy!
   (a fixed piece of paper can prevent this)
if you don't know how to do it beg a friendly technician!

For the last time, Bobby. Lack of belief in YOUR god does NOT imply
atheism. Just because some moslems aren't moral does not mean they don't
believe in a god named Allah, although their Allah may not do the things
your Allah does. If a moslem says he/she believes that a god exists, he/she

No, it is independent of the speedometer. The gun processes two doppler
returns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed
of the target, taking the difference between the two. Some guns with
a "moving mode" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed
preferentially at the pavement.

Car and Driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in
1985. I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus
radar-measured ticket. It detailed "moving mode," which is easier to
defend against because of the increased amount of variables.

Now, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW
PeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls
the rig an "electronic brake" since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down.

My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's
astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with
the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the 
distributor pickup.  Very poor design.

I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing
to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is
wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting
out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference
between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are
usually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation
when you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when
you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details
and addresses).

Good advice.  Hams will frequently give their call, and will never use
a "handle."  They are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well,
but that's not to say that they don't from time to time.

If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first.
I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain
everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then
on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug
and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably
didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit
they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or
something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they
report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating
that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough
liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to
happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information
on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the
AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.
There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.
Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks
to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to "go ballistic",
but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been
reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume
it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will
refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for
PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with
tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.
I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the
domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions
about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.
For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help
quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the
computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,
physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,
as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked
things that the patients should have found out from their physician
but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.
Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to
ask the system, we hope.

	There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground
in the breaker box.  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL
wire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in
any of the outlet boxes).

	The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for
the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)
wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safe
to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the 
grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding
conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breaker-box end).

There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
voice telling you the number of the line.  Unfortunately, for the
life of me I can't remember what it is. The telephone technicians
use it all the time.  We used to play around with this in our
dorm rooms since there were multiple phone lines running between
rooms.

Does GX take the place of 32 bit QD or add to it? Right now 32 bit is
kinda aesthetically a pain in a few places because of hacks upon hacks

where you have to cast CGrafPorts to GrafPorts and such. It would be a

Don't get too excited; Signetics, not Motorola, gave the 68070 its number.
The 68070, if I understand rightly, uses the 68000 instruction set, and has
an on-chip serial port and DMA.  (It will run at up to 15 MHz--I'm typing
at a computer using a 68070 running at that rate, so I know that it can

And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-
Bernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene
had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.
The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors
of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.

I don't think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion
of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational
is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases
of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.

For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of
enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a
friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but
Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking
at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he
lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic
acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.

Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers
(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because
he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks
contained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which
he never admitted publically.

Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery
started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile
and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.
Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the
student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the
student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the
research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery
(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).

Hi,

we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance, and have a
wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use
to adjudicate a contract next week.

Although the output data is easy for us to present, there seems to be
little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for
straightforward inhalation therapy (eg: for asthmatics).

Some say that the droplets must be smaller than 5 microns, whilst
others say that if they are too small they will not be effective.

Anyone up on this topic who could summarise the current status ?

Cheers,

The case report of the first xenotransplant was published in Lancet 1993; 341:65-71.
I can send you a reprint if you are interested.
There was  another paper, sort of a tour of the horizon, written by Starzl and
published in the Resident's Edition of the Annals of Surgery (vol 216, October 1992).
It's in the Surgical Resident's Newsletter section, so you won't find it in the regular
issue of the Annals. I don't have any reprints of that one.
A paper has been accepted for publication by Immunology Today, though I'm not sure
when it's coming out, describing our experience with the two xenografts done to date.


As for segmental liver transplants from living related donors I must confess to a total
ignorance of that literature. We are philosophically opposed to those, and I don't keep 
up with that particular field.

So, only intelligent beings can be moral, even if the bahavior of other

Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily, but they
don't.  Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because

Boy, you computer people only know 1s and 0s, but not much about logic. :-)

No. I did not said MSG was not the culprit. What I argued was that that
there was enough reasonable doubt to convict MSG.  

If you want to convict MSG, show me the evidence, not quilty by suspicion.

Nobody is forcing you to change what you believe.  But I certainly don't
want to see somebody preach to ban pepper because that makes him/her
sneeze. That is exactly what some anti-MSG activitiests are doing

Look, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant.
I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last
name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.

What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from
a recent FDA hearing:

           ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect
on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is
``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate
has made them sick.''

And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double
blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also
had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.

Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group,
some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG
emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything. 

My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably
20-1 outnumbered.

I don't want texture mapped, cause if I did I'd asked for them. :)  Just
a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons.  As for the processor, it'd
be for a minimum of a 286... maybe 386 if I can't find a good one for 286s.
Ideally, I want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport,
and write to an arbitrary location in memory.  Of course the chances of
finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source
with it.  Oh, and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise it'd be too
slow.  I've seen some polygon routines in C, and they've all been waaay too
slow.  Its for a 3D vector graphics program.  I've been hunting high and low
for a polyn function in ASM, and I can't find one anywhere that I can use.
I've found one or two polyn functions, but my ASM is pretty bad, so I won't
even try to rewrite them. :)

It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the
arguments used. Namely, whenever people you identify as Muslims are
the victims of the attacks of others, they are used an argument for
the bad situation of Muslims. But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize
others are named, they do not count as an argument because what these
people did was not done as a true Muslims. No mention is made how Muslims
are the cause of a bad situation of another party.

A.  Folks, do we have an FAQ on tinnitus yet?

B.  As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist
who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following
are reasonable conclusions:

1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.
2. The cause it not understood.
3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.
4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but
there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with
any of these experimental drugs.
5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.
6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes
abates or goes away after a few months.
7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.
8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.
9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on
something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.
10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.
11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there
is not.

I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz
68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously
a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the
systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works
fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer
of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)
might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some
suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications
problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?
Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought
that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). 
Are there any MC68882RC33?

	I too am interested in peoples' experience with accelerators for the

I consider upgrading to an SE/30 motherboard?  Obviously, buying a new mac

You should have tried one of the soc.culture groups in the Middle East
or South Asia area (they are a little more open than the Islam channel).  
I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the 
world created itself (or something like that) so each particle is a God 
which created the other Gods.  The soc.culture.african is also nice for 
some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion.  Especially 
when Sudan is mentioned.

Funny about that... my wife (my girlfriend at the time) used to get sick 
after eating certain foods at various Asian restaurants, and never knew 
why.  She'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously.  A couple of us 
ventured a connection with MSG, and her response was: "MSG?  What's that?".  
It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and 
chips... which I noticed (later) had MSG on the label.  Don't know about 
double blinds, but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurants.

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
(not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a
"dag" as well as the outer coating.

Thankfully, I didn't need to go to a f****** library to find it, either.

The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than

>    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only
>(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best bet

That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire
(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240
all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly
remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all
of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered
DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used
with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.

My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:

(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add
    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going
    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.
    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it
    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).

(2) On the Mac side, you will need:
    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).
    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).
    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be
      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).
    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the
      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is
      self-terminated or not.
    - configure MacTCP to use "Ethernet".

(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:
    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.
    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.
      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the
      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).
    - get a 25ohm terminator.

Your two-machine network will look like this:

	The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware,
read's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volume
setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and
wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.


If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device,
or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is
possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the 
'sad mac' sound.


This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.
If you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feel
there is something incorrect with the logic board. 

My Quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having.

the Q700 will only do 8bit or 24bit color.  if you want the higher
color depth, it's 2MB's of VRAM altogether for a monitor up to 16".

for a 21" monitor, you can get 8bit max.

I'd be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options.

In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed "movies".
They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of
Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it
had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many 
other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what
kind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as
I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you
put 11 minutes on one floppy disk?

In the May issue of C't Magazine was an article about upgrading 040 models
of apple. They simply change crystals and add a fan.
Hammerhead: Centris 610 was able to work with 25 MHz (cooler prefered)
            and for 1000 DM you get an 68040 (33MHz) which works with the
            appropriate crystal at full speed. (extra cooling required)    
            Centris 650 like Quadra 700 with extra cooling 33MHz works on
            most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a
            Quadra 950 at 40 MHz wow! But for better description you should

To construct a Kirlian device find a copy of _Handbook of Psychic

Congress 73-88532.  It describes the necessary equipment and
 suppliers for the Tesla coil or alternatives, the copper plate and
setup. I used a pack of SX-70 film and removed a single pack in a
dark room, then made the exposure, put it back in the film pack and
ran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developing
and very high quality.  It is a good way to experience what Kirlian
Photography is really and what it is not.  As you know all ready,
it is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significant.
Variations caused by exposure time, distance from the plate, or
pressure on the plate, or variations in the photo materials are not
important.

	I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  The
processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the
computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is
pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed
to increase speed among other things.

	I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without 
giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when 
you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.
Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to 
its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?

	Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers
is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is
based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a
processor to speed it up.  

	But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure
processor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work
well and another will not based on its design, then we can get
somewhere with our discussions.

	Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than
most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least)
all had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at
much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase'
of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use
transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).

	Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are
a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections
at a time.  Your hands will cramp.  Battery-powered wire-wrap guns
are available in the $150 range, and so are the little
twiddle-stick manual types ($15).  For a modest project, of
a couple hundred connections, I'd prefer to borrow a professional
AC unit... or a pneumatic one.

Obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly 
introducing another.  Cancer mestastizes.  My imperfect understanding of 
the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard. 
I haven't done the research on it, but I don't recall ever hearing of a 
case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion.  Probably just a 
common sense kind of arbitrary precaution.  Transmissable diseases like 
malaria though are obviously another story.

Ideologies also split, giving more to disagree upon, and may also lead

One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach
to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it
that women and men are spiritual equals.

I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have
souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be
forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the
after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the
part saying "For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward"
says they have souls.  

(If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then 
I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)

As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority
in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give
all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to
Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,
denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be
considered a disbeliever in Islam.

>Quite similar to you other post, even when the Quran does not encourage
>slavery, it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to
>slavery. It is a non sequitur.

Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and
thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the
Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly
answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings
it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals
of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that
since women can clearly be "forgiven" and "rewarded" they _must_ have
souls (from the above verse).

Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than
try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this
passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on
ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations 
fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these
interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can
ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try
to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but
provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.

Apparently not.

In response to his claim that it "terrifies" gay people not to be able
to "indoctrinate children to our lifestyle" (or words to that effect),
I sent Roger a very calm, carefully-written, detailed letter
explaining simply why the BSA policy does, indeed terrify me.  I did

In fact, that's exactly the point: people can control their behavior.
Because of that fact, there is no need for a blanket ban on
homosexuals.

	Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry -- wrong. It would be an

fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat

------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------

You've heard about Apple's great new customer "support" program.  Well,
think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple
computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:

In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort
by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with
certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice "stick" in
the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the
machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the
reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of
BCGA65431. You'll recognize this "sticky button" symptom immediately if you
have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.

Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead 
suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly
(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described
my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told
Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of
warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering
where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the
serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)
range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.

Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make
it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.
Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you
know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start
hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.
Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:

                  United States      1-800-776-2333
                  Canada             800-665-2775
                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01
                  Australia          61-2-452-8000
                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500

If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask
for a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register
the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.

Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user
bases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to
me or post yet another "sticky-button" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If
enough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple
will eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy
to stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the
next, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.

As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_
and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is
described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications
do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be
accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and
reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.

But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy
reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a
large part of the history of science.

There are a couple of negative points to make here:

1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct
verification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted
part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What
would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical
reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could
lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of
experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.

(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.
I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less
a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it
is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather
directly verifying the existence of qi.)

2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational
experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and
interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical
controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,
there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,
petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which
computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical
function of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.

The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate
part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.

Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;
but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;
that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate
polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was
indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation had
led to a replicable, and important, result.

This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not
even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their
theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not
concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress
the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they
think supports their position (creationists).

To use the grayscale features, I believe you need a Mac equipped

not mentioned in "Apple Facts" (guide for apple sellers), in the

I have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply (Made

tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a 
rectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  It
is about 0.2"x0.2"x0.1", with both leads coming out of one of the
0.1"x0.1" sides.  I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asian
company, but I can find no information as to a supplier.  This fuse
is rated at 1A, 130C.  Does anyone have a source for this fuse?  I
only need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want
to talk to me, let alone, deal with me.

Please advise via E-mail.

Thanks,

060 fastest, then Pentium, with the first versions of the PowerPC

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed.
Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory
system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If
you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory
every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but
it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.

And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the 68030.

I'd like to ask a few more questions.
1.  What are the advantages of buying a global village
Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra, Zoom etc?
2.  I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software.
Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems
of Supra?  What kind of incompatibility is it?
3.  If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold, is there any
possibility to add a voice option in the near future?
4.  Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer
this coming summer?
5.  A person did mention a new AT&T modem.  Is it
getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines?
6.  If I want the best, fastest, most economically sound and
possible voice option, what fax modem should I buy?

Sorry for posting so many questions, but I think they're necessary.
I promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder.

Thanks so much in advance.

work better for images.

I've seen the ScanMan go for as little as $100 used. It is a reasonable buy

The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,
exploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser
in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation.

It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part
time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.
It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.
Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,
usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically
takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.

The Flat-Earthers state that "the Earth is flat" is a fact. I don't accept
this, I think it's an unproven opinion, and I think the Round-Earthers are
right because they have better evidence than the Flat-Earthers do.

Although I can't prove that a god doesn't exist, the arguments used to
support a god's existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and I'm not
going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a
reason to believe in a god that I absolutely can't ignore.

A while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken,
in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he
wrote something like "Can you prove it isn't so?" I certainly can't, but
I'm not going to believe him, because he based his "proof" on some really
questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it "circumstancial
evidence" :] ).

So far, atheism hasn't made me kill anyone, and I'm regarded as quite an
agreeable fellow, really. :)

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of 
that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than 
you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the 
printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the 
printer)

A sage said to me: "Do you want one copy or lots of copies?", "One", 
"Inkjet".

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter 
will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that 
are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.

HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the 
software package has no inkjet driver. 

There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a 
page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a 
laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers 
actually use this facility.
(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)

		    Software Tools to help with RSI
		    -------------------------------
 
This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI.
This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar
programs and digital watches...
 
Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information
or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.

I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people
who have evaluated them or are using them.

Changes in this version:

     Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool 
     for Windows.


TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use,
by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include
advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to
 
warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.

Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has
a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing
all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.
These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their
warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your 
body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.

 
    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)
    Available from:
	Bright Star
	Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697
    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows
    Description:
	Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. 
	Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations
	on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best 
	with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible
	to record your own messages to warn of break.
 
    Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)
    Available from:
	Media Vision
	Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563
    Platforms: PC
    Description:
	A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.
	Includes 'At Your Service'.
 
    Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)
    Available from:
	Escape Ergonomics, Inc
	1111 W. El Camino Real
	Suite 109
	Mailstop 403
	Sunnyvale, CA
	Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410
    Platforms: DOS
    Description:
	Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take
	breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or
	after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.
	It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from
	a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work
	you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.
	Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on
	how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.

	CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use 
	to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information
	on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.
	A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.

	CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then
	warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear
	useful when used with Windows.

	Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.

    Comments:
	The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better
	to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to
	measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff
	is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,
	as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company 
	to pay up for RSI management tools.  

    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)
    Available from:
	RAN Enterprises
	One Woodland Park Dr.
	Haverhill, MA  01830, US
	Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)
    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]
    Description:
	Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take
	breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally
	displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are
	animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the
	correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training 
	exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions
	you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help 
	on workplace ergonomics.  

	Quote from their literature:

	"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic
	sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work
	all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent
	Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve
	your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these
	help you to become more relaxed and productive."
 
	"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.
	Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup
	for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to
	promote healthy and efficient computer use. 
	
	Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts
	for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).
 
    Comments:
	I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say
	it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it
	does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it
	interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which
	is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on
	Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure
	why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has
	one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not
	require any sound hardware.

    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)
    Available from:
	Visionary Software
	P.O. Box 69447
	Portland, OR  97201, US
	Tel: +1 (503) 246-6200
    Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)
    Description:
	Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break
	with dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises
	to do during breaks, and information on configuring your
	workstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;
	quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is
	bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how
	equivalent this is to the Mac version.
	
	The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher 
	Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful

    Comments:
	I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface

	expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only
	tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it
	on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!
	Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does 
	have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,
	which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.

    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)
    Available from:
	Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk
	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar
    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)
    Description:
	This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you
	to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously
	typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check
	that you really do take a break, and tells you when you
	can start typing again.  

	Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing
	today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you
	know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information
	to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  

	The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),
	in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message
	(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> 
	has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for 
	X, Zephyr and Mach.

	Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk
	(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,
	X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give 
	feedback.

    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs
    Available from:
	Various sources
    Platforms: Various
    Description:
	Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming
	appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.
	Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit
	a program to run at a specific time to display a message to
	the screen.

	Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and
	include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so
	you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you
	want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.
	Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter
	9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break
	is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat 
	for the next appointment.

	By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes
	that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this
	file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with
	a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments
	with RSI exercises.

	The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. 
	An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job
	that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will
	depend a lot on your operating system.

	While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing 
	yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI 
	management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to
	write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating
	system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.

    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers
    Available from:
	Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.
    Description:
	Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable
	number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either
	manually or automatically.  

	While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you
	are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from
	a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great
	advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you
	are doing.
	
    Comments:
	My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to
	my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which
	actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left
	arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been
	very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.

	I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but
	these are not much good because they do not give an audible
	warning of the end of the time period!


KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping
so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  
One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how 
you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you
are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,
and may therefore make matters worse.

    Tool: hsh (public domain)
    Available from:
	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar
    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)
    Description:
	Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.
	Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or
	an xterm, but not most X programs).

    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)
    Available from:
	Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c
	Also built into Windows 3.x. 
    Description:
	The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout
	that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent
	RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since 
	it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)

Are you sure that he needs a two way converter? If he wants only
RS232->TTL I would suggest the MC1489, its very cheap (0.80 DM in
Germany). This chip needs only +5V. The MC1488 TTL->RS232-Converter
uses +12V and -12V.

BTW... The MAX232 and compatibles seem to be expensive in the USA...
I paid 2.95 DM for a ITS80272 (made by Harris), its absolutely
compatible with the MAX232 or the ICL232.

When you say, "By definition", what exactly is being defined;
certainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the "rules of
nature" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but
actually cause it. If that's what you mean I'd like to hear your

I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa
against Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally
insulting. 

I think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long
posting, and to say 

	"I don't know if you are doing so, but it 
	seems you are implying....."

is at the very best quite disingenuous, and perhaps even
dishonest.    If anyone care to dig back and read the full
posting, they will see nothing of the kind.

I trust you don't deny that Islamic teaching has "something
to do" with the fatwa against Rushdie?

You'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing
in the new colours.

Use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range
from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the
range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).

Then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and
the result should be ok.

You might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have
more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode.

There is no contradiction here. It is essential in the sense that your
body needs it. It is non-essential in the sense that your body can
produce enough of it without supplement.

Not Quite the point to be considdered here!
Fact: If/When Apple release system 7 (or what ever is current at the time 
of release) then you will see shortly afterwards Apple no longer producing 
Hardware...Look at Next with their NextStep486 to see what happens.
Who is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper 
else where! (Heck we can get a Sun Workstation cheaper than a Quadra, and 
infact we have a number of times!!!, it ALL comes down to $$$$)

No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less 
profit in Hardware, So the Next Step (no pun intended...well sort of), is 
to make the money in software (look at Microsoft if you think it can't 
happen!), after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE 
hardware platform.

As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers, so will the 
temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much 
for Apple! (50 million copies @ $100 is SERIOUS money!).

Not a good idea to compare processor power. Doesn't make sense for real

At least for x86 systems doubling the clock speed increases performance

The Atari 2600 used a 6502 CPU, just like their entire 8-bit line
(400, 800,1200,1400, 1440, 130xe, 65xe computers, as well as the 5200
game machine). The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600
might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.

Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for
their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I
would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking
with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the
2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).
Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into
a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to
backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could
be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them
into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.

Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got
two 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa
cartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and
handling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo
(interested in that too?).

Hope that helps your question... I might grab some 6502's out too,
since they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers).

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded
with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on
its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time
SEEING the grayscale image you want to print.

I am looking for some information of hidden line removal using Roberts

notes given in class leave a LOT to be desired, so I would vastly
appreciate any help.

Actually any algorithm would be nice (Roberts or no).  The main problem
is two objects intersecting in x and y dimensions, need to know which
lines to clip off so that one object will appear in front of another.

If you can give me an ftp address and filename, or even the name of a

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just
releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the
original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
easier cleaning.

If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the
new ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at
the guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent
with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw
heads.

If one is a vegan (a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at i.e eggs, 
milk, cheese, etc., after about 3 years of a vegan diet, you need to start 
taking B12 supplements because b12 is found only in animals.) Acutally our 
bodies make B12, I think, but our bodies use up our own B12 after 2 or 3 
years.  
Lacto-oveo vegetarians, like myself, still get B12 through milk products 
and eggs, so we don't need supplements.
And If anyone knows more, PLEASE post it.  I'm nearly contridicting myself

Yes, but typically they *don't*.  Not every wild flight of fancy serves
(or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is
somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an
example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about
Kekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded
as an *extreme* example of a "non-rational" process in science whereby
a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?

Of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why
Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails.
Surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about
*this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived
*analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning "extra-scientific"?
Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction,
the use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination,
is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps
closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?

I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 1.0, 
and it works on System7.  Course, I only use the SWA Dutch
and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it, due to the 4x size
requirement to print to the HP. (ie: must have 40pnt definition
to print a 10pnt font)  When I upgraded,  I talked to Orange
Micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely
works with System7.  However, the upgrade was US$40, so I
passed.

Hope this helps?

   I have a BACK MACHINE and have had one since January.  While I have not 
found it to be a panacea for my back pain, I think it has helped somewhat. 
It MAINLY acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associated
with pain.  I am taking less pain medication than I was previously.  
   The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their return 
policy.  They extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to return 
the machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it. 
They encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously. 
   Like I said, I can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched out
and I am in less pain.

	   In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my
   knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic
   object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns
   or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type
   of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might
   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
   the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.

There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals)
published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be
more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe
what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.  

These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can
be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the
moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the
"energy signature" of organic objects.

I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.
I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by
first dunking them in water.

I have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5" MO drive and now a Sharp color
scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700. 
No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2
boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".

My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they
must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO
drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

Good luck.

No.  That these drugs happen to be useful as antidepressants is neither

I usually use "Algorithms for graphics and image processing" by
Theodosios Pavlidis, but other people here got them same idea and now
3 of 4 copies in the libraries have been stolen!

Another reference is "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and
Wintz/Wood, which is widely available but a little expensive ($55

You should be able to pick up an ADB cable at any computer wiring store...
I'd give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary, but a: I'm
in Victoria (B.C., Canada) and b: I don't think an address in Calgary would
help you too much....basically however I just phoned them up, and they

I pondered it for all of ten seconds when I realised that since
we don't have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity,
and since the whole issue of "depression" isn't at all well 
defined for earlier centuries, you are probably talking crap.

Of course, you could pull a Mozumder on us, and say that people
who are having sex outside marriage are *defined* to be depressed.

I can't say I'd ever noticed, myself.

OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable
interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It
is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly
from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high
performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL
means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no
guarantee that your performance would be comparable.

If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a
valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI
sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we
understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a
shot.

|> 
|> I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a

|> for a while, rather than being flushed.

As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in
1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates
sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5
years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI
('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power
Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a
particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics
architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every
18 months to 2 years.

These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become
almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new
platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,
faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we
don't, we become uncompetitive.

From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your
current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but
if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep
for one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some
of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as
the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series
multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain
a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge
R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.

If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or

Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a
great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because
again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule
slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were
counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and
would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial
analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our
commitments.

Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor
technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at
least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature
of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is
really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability
of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.

There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live
with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,
we know it.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new
wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print
GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer
(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not
possible).

This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to
Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It
is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.

SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour
version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the
'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it
gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).

There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older
computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been
upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal
with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult 
time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).

Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT
Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to
do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300
is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).

How does that qualify?
Indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance.
I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as
"accepted uncritically," especially the few that are legend.
Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but
they don't meet the other criterions.
Also...

You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to
launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the
requirements of myth.)

Ah, but not everyone "knows" that god exists.  So you have
a fallacy.

And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy?

...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting

If the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason
to doubt the Bible, because not everyone "knows" your alleged
god's alleged existance.

1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far
from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;
it is only a proof that some people have thought that there
was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been
writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the
case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the
only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it.
And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the
interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.

2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.

3) Again, read the FAQ.

>freedom. You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to

Bzzt...wrong answer!
Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and
rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the
other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except
on the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence.
Gravity is obvious; gods aren't.

>Secondly, human reason is very comforatble with the concept of God, so

No, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of
"God"; it has usually come back to the existance of "god".
In other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian
god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much
of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as
the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces
are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,
human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to
be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural
tendancy to believe in "God" only exists in religious wishful
thinking.

>I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently

Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and
it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence.
Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already
believe in the divinity.
First, not all atheists believe the same things about human
nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not,
YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at
the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric
approach.  Try looking at the outside world as well when
you attempt to sum up all of humanity.

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs
for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
Good instructions are included with the chokes.
If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

	I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think
you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM
+/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common
I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940.
I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of
difference.

	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote,
and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very
detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding
specs. if the system uses that.

From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are
protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube!]

{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have
them.}

Suggestion: look in the RS data book. They have several RS232
transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the
LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
ask me why. I've never used them before.

Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector. Two are listed in the
RS catalogue. If you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail
me.

If she is having problems with fresh vegetables, the guess is that there
is some obstruction of the intestine.  Without knowing more it is not
possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,
or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are
no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate
to obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on 
recurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from
recurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as 
recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the
intestine.

Purists often distinguish between "true" clubbing and "pseudo"
clubbing, the difference being that with "true" clubbing the
angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly
negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).
With "pseudo" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then
negative, which is the normal situation. "Real" internists
can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple
of minutes.

Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is
entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists
love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only "true" clubbing
is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of
diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes
both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of
these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems
leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is
very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the 
congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac
catheterization. 

The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to
some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to
dilate abnormally. 

Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is
a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,
the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.

Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and
a good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy
duty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v 
(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).

An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power
goes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and
then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in
humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and
cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.
Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:
my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-
grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife
had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-
grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous
farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of
childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,
contain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and
baby, May 6, 1853."

>You wanted

More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have
direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.

It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of
reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.

Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine
design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.

My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack
in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.

We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although
I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked
them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.
I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly
indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting
until an emergency to give in.

And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.
We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main
decisions were really hers.

I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that

But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was
unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.
In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings
have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem
all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious
permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,
an esthetic consideration.

Do you honestly hold to that tripe Charley? For a start there are enough
current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write
above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek
Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good
old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared
to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost
unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been
edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much
more congenial fellow I must say. 

If you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you
some quotes. At least the headings haven't changed much.

[...stuff deleted...]

Computers are an excellent example...of evolution without "a" creator.
We did not "create" computers.  We did not create the sand that goes
into the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into
processor board.  We took these things and put them together in an
interesting way. Just like plants "create" oxygen using light through 
photosynthesis.  It's a much bigger leap to talk about something that
created "everything" from nothing.  I find it unfathomable to resort
to believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists: we
simply are incapable of understanding our beginnings -- if there even
were beginnings at all.  And that's ok with me.  The present keeps me
perfectly busy.

    To display Millions of colors on a 16" monitor you need 2MB of VRAM
in the Q950.

    Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q800 comes
with.

    Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of
the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM. It only
knows 1MB and 2MB.

>From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
>16-bit color, is that correct?

    Yes, this is correct. You get to 1MB by putting 2 256k VRAM SIMMs
into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q800's motherboard.

>Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they

    Yup. You have to take off the power supply. It's only a couple of

number of SCSI devices connected (Quantum LP52, Maxtor 213, Toshiba MK156F via
Emulex adapter, Pioneer DRM-600) and have had no trouble.

I am using the stock cooling facilities, I considered adding a fan/heat pump,
but don't feel they are necessary (for my box anyway). I have a temp meter on
order and plan to do some measurements when it arrives in a few weeks. Email me
if you want to see the results.

I'd appreciate it greatly if someone could E-mail me the following:
(if you only know one, that's fine)
1) Specs for the 68040 (esp. how it compares to the Pentium)
2) Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...

I'm interested in speeds, systems it can run (Windows NT, RISC, or whatever),
costs, bus info, register info.  All the technical info.

I am hoping that the 68040 can win yet another battle against the intel people.
 
:)  Thanks for any info you can give.

Thanks.

The fonts/chars had color, depth and even textures associated with

    I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a
great card especially with my multimedia presentations.  It runs graphics
and animation as well as some near full motion video very well.  The only
thing I can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors.  Its qualit in
between 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly
compromise speed.  It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes
with some great software, but Im not so sure about the excelerator
part.  I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster
than that.  One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver
from ROM at startup, (I think) because I have never had to load it for
links386 or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at
startup.

==3== General info on injuries

First, and foremost of importance: if you experience pain at all, then
you absolutely need to go see a doctor.  As soon as you possibly can.  The
difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery
and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety
doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,
any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in
these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.

The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from
a wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational
Safety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and
Rehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide".

First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):
(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)

  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries
  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI
  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI
  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI
  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)
  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.
  Pronation: Turning the palm down.
  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.
  Supination: Turning the palm up.
  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.
  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.
  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.
  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.
  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.
  Abduction: Moving away from the body.
  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.

Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse
conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,
tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.
Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle
discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of
tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily "the problem."

--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.

Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which
pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict
the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,
you're completely restricting your blood flow.

Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,
then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates
nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.

Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the
load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes
things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,
and the cycle continues.

Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from
your nerves.  They need blood too.

Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change
for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never
relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor
ergonomics, only make things worse.

--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:

(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute
injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have
less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)

Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis
occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to
cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability
to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets
inflamed, and you've got your problem.

Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon
can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,
and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more
swelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entails
a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse
with repetitive activity.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your
fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include
feeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.
CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.

Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where
the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly
compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.
AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS 
disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy 
(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).

Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for
a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS
conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors
misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you
may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion
before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).

==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment

The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce
tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.
If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out
the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding
principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.
EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every
three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,
calm down, and relax.

If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and
relaxation are really a big deal.

There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce
inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad
posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen
your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture
and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold
contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best
for you.

--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was
written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from
Appendix 10. -- dwallach]

. Let your shoulders relax.
. Let your elbows swing free.
. Keep your wrists straight.
. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.
. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.
. Try leaning back in the chair.
. Don't slouch or slump forward.
. Alter your posture from time to time.
. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.

Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There 
should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,
and your thighs should not slope too much.

Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable
to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy
is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a
footrest.

Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space
between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in
the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this
area.

If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning
back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.

[Now, I diverge a little from the text]

A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go
find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,
back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in
the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm
rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good
store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  The
name says it all.

--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:

There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some
people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you
shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your
keyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and then
lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands
when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid
pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads
may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and
look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's
often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or
deviated hands.

Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly
designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.
Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.

==5== Requests for more info

Clearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive
is incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like
to submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.

If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be
wonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd
love somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the
above sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.

I pointed out the secession movement in Aceh which has also been
brutally dealt with in the past by the Indonesian government.  The
harshly with all secessionist movements.
the evidence, it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealt
very harshly with all secession movements.

I know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long time
was Benny Murdani -- a "Christian".  Indonesia has been heavy handed in
East Timor for a long time , even when Murdani was head of the armed
forces.  The people who make up the
Indonesian government are in general motivated by national interests,
not religious ones.

Hi there

I am very interested in Rayshade 4.00. I have managed to make a chessboard
for Rayshade. Unfortunately I still have to do the knight (horse). Any ideas?
I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces. The board is marble.
Unfortunately black won't work very well for the one side. Anybody with ideas
for nice surfaces?

I would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield
command. Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this, and I don't have
Craig Kolb's email address. Anybody with ideas, because this is essential
for my next venture into raytracing.

Where should I post the finished chessboard?

Is there anybody else using rayshade on non-Unix systems?

How fast does Unix render?

Thanks

Rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics, but have no
artistic talent.

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the
information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP
List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,
GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the
version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on
export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits
internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit
display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to
convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.
But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.
CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check
the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will
be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means
"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip
    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip
    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing
    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG",
"VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,
but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something
of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common
denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	"begin" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	"begin" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

I think this is a big leap sex->depression.  One example is myself,
where no sex->depression :)  But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline,
depression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say 
depression->promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to come
from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and
promiscuity is used as an escape.
Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an
emotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of)
marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as
what is expected from a married couple.  Of course, this is just 
my opinion.

Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation.

Bad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple
Macintosh PowerBook Duos) 
MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.

COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993

By Raines Cohen

     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook
Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss
and other problems.

     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week
issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM
products from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.
Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.

     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called
selfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But
Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with
nonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to
wake from sleep.

     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part
number stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips
instead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may
not tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses
nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed
while the Duo sleeps.

     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo
cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology
Works said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are
certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.

     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers
Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is
compatible with the slower chips.

     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that
some third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner
of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally
when in a Duo Dock.

     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it
originally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all
customers free upgrades to cards that fit.

It depends on the cause of the pneumonia.  For treating bacterial

is usually considered the antibiotic of choice, since it covers

(7) Detail:

   Initialization:
      Set default display type to highest display type.
      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy
      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
+       The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".
+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file.
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is.
        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check
        standard extension. Still fail, report error.
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.
        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
          (except ESCAPE).
        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.
        ESCAPE to terminate.
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.
        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,
     COMMENT about this program,
     Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
     I need your suggestion to improve this program.

	I'm not sure who the "original respondent" was but to
reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just
as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen
in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab
_Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of
the spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength
specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not
synonymous.
	So in sum and to beat a dead horse:
	(1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of
absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength,
the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.
	(2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral
sensitivities and are not any more "color sensitive" than are rods,
ommatidia or other photoreceptors.
	(3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which
sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are
"processed centrally".  (The handwave is intentional)

	I've worked and published research on rods and cones for over
10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can "detect color"
is frustrating.  But don't take my word for it.  I'm reposting a few
excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color
vision texts.

Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and
ability to insult people. You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician.
However, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific
research refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster sought
to start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a little
effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is a
healthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you can
verbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are the
studies?

I appoligize if this sounds flamish. I simply would like to see the thread get
back on track.

Subject: GETTING AIDS FROM ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES
Organization: University of California, Berkeley

   someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture
   needles.....

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who               
themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS         
from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal
immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant 
involved with acupuncture needle insertion. 

Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      
do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of 
diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, 
being poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        
If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get 
their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      
The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly 
use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              
patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates 
this risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and            
nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        
Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all 
solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into 
meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require 
the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be 
injected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin is 
puntured. On the other hand when the solid 
acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle 
from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that 
haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain 
on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. 

Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory 
and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture 
site.


While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease 
transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for 
what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.
Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  
thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  
oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  
the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  
type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  
unobjectionable). Got it ?

Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive
_Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by
either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when
not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that
similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).  

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.  

Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved
one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having 
recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore
or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  
The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather
than being from an external source.

Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,
or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a
source of the anxiety.

In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the
individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their
daily routine and social relationships.

Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes
certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating
obsessions and compulsions.

The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the
DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .

In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was
 slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel. But, this is using a system designed
 for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie
 quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.
    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system
 at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the
 speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060. I think
 it laps the pentium.

I have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and

Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a
message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it
is again.

Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and
seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share
information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two
other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.

If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will
make it happen and provide you with the details.

BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my
research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this
service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program
searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology
works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have
been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded
and used to improve the system.

This database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new
information.  To try it out, do the following

	telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca
	login: chat

	Then select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases.

Kirlian photography is taking pictures of the corona discharge from

millions of times larger than any biologically created fields.  If you
want to record the biologically created electric fields, you've got to
use low-noise, high-gain sensors typical of EEGs and EKGs.  Kirlian

  Damn right you can't provide any evidence for it.  

  Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a
  simple premise.  If they were, psychology would be a hard science
  with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.  

  Your premise may well be right.  It is much more likely, however,
  that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as
  well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  Were I to
  pretend to have all the answers (and I don't), I would say that the
  xenophobia, guilt, and intolerance brought about by adherence to 
  fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing
  the members of our society.

  Your mileage obviously varies.

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be "good things", I
question whether they come very close to being objective values.
Especially considering that at one time or another each has been
viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with
anything that could be said to be universally "good" or "bad".

And when I referred to "the truth" I was using the term
hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a
thing.

True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than
personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any
sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any
socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some "higher authority"
(aka, absolute moral truth).

An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth?
Interesting notion.   :-)

Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is
good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most
people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as
being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else
insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?

Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing
over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those
aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a
commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long &
healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is
incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most
agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating
production.  The equation is always more complex than presented.
To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own
conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it.

I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small
systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines.
(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.)
Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:

1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is
	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground
	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. 

2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load
	on the clock lines. 

3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high
	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff
	capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.
	What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,
	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent
	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly
	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably
	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,
	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high
	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).

4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for
	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.
	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I
	needed.

 How about this description: "An object that is, at one time, both a
Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle"? I hold that no object satisfying
this description could exist. The description is inconsistent, and hence
describes an object that could not exist.
 Now, suppose someone pointed to a bicycle, and said, "That object is,
at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle." This does
not mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description
was incorrectly applied.
 
 The atheist says, "The descriptions of God that I have been presented with
are contradictory, and hence describe something that cannot exist."
 Now, your position (so far as I can gather) is that God exists, but the
descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions
of It.
 This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and,
when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one,
are told that it is a "Euclidean circle-square". Can they be blamed for
doubting rather strongly that this 'bicycle' exists at all?

 Nobody is saying that you shouldn't be allowed to use msg.  Just

then the option of the eater to use it.  If you make a commerical

I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet,
I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only
a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,
resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to
look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one
grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the
presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However,
you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.

The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as
much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets.
Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe
that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).

If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say
fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain
(I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9
months).

This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he
smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique
I'd never seen before.

He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.
The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,
made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.

In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar
quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two
teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.

On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with
two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly
went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.

Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises
and concerns me are:

1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?

2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color
    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring
    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected
    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,
    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being
    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?

3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated
    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract
    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever
    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea
    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do
    so.

WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),
I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy
taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently
stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,
getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,
then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.

My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight
stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort
of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after
the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,
just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?

I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping
on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because
it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill
non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this
duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals
at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the
floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire
in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.

And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that
smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains
nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually
has some standing, don't know about the others.

An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was
discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting
a lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.
This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.
The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended
himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day
for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-
broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my
immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal
broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!

 Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably 
consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does
not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by
latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for
about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at
most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life
has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before
there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...
mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just
fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows
that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what
brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then
how could it exist before humans?

 Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about
biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There
is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'
in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a
collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the
degeneration of the genetic code'.

 Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and
bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is
harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby
constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic
plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But
it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as
much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even
when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in
the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible
died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',
(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and
died off for lack of nearby hosts.
 I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few
hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to
be getting less nasty w/age...

 Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?
And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It
seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift
humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less
lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,
imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us
by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning
ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune
system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made
our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and
their descendents would need to fight off diseases?

 Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the
phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'
system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system
that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a
perfect system. At least, IMHO.
 Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a
bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the
original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in
inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?
If so, why could God not have used better materials?
 Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,
of did It just choose not to?

[deletions]
>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.

 My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for
the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.) But, I couldn't

a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.
             
I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the          
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free. tell me
if you have a similar experience with them.

Bobby-

A few posts ago you said that Lucifer had no free will.  From the above
it seems the JW believes the contrary.

Are you talking about the same Lucifer?

If so, can you suggest an experiment to determine which of you is wrong?

Or do you claim that you are both right?

==============
Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues

    Mini outline:
        1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
        2. X terminals
        3. NeXT
        4. Silicon Graphics
        5. IBM RS/6000
	6. Other stuff

    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port

	If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
	(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding
	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation
	runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used
	PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable
	to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read
	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.

	The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.

	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and
	even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server
	extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your
	server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings
	appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,
	you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,
	or bugging your vendor.

	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.
	Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.

	Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.

    2. X terminals

	Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use
	PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all
	set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the
	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add
	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around
	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.

    3. NeXT

	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop
	Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they
	were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of
	upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!

    4. Silicon Graphics

	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and
	beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't
	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not
	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by
	upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more
	details.

    5. IBM RS/6000

	IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||
	Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||
	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||
	smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||
	it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||
	works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||
	told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||
	anything new, please send me e-mail.				    ||
    
    6. Other stuff

	Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)
	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your
	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can
	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either
	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in
	luck.  Contact the companies for more details.


Apple Adjustable Keyboard
    Apple Computer, Inc.
    Sales offices all over the place.

    Availability: February, 1993
    Price: $219
    Supports: Mac only

    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The
    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate
    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are
    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.

    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.
    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.

    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not
    directly attachable to the keyboard.

    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from
    TidBITS available there.


FlexPro Keyboard
    Key Tronic
    Phone: 800-262-6006
    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299
    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops

    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)
    Price: $489 (?)
    Supports: PC only (highly likely)

    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's
    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both
    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.
    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.

    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will
    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.


DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)
    Dragon Systems, Inc.
    320 Nevada Street
    Newton, MA  02160

    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200
    Fax: 617-527-0372

    Shipping: Now.

    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)
	   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)
	   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.
    
    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only
		   (3rd party support for Mac)

	Free software support for X windows is also available -- your
	PC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a
	serial cable or network.  The program is called a2x, and is
	available via anonymous ftp:

	soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z
	export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)

	If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want
	to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about
	this sort of thing.

    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.
    Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles
    (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you
    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.

    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions
    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple
    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file
    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.
    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between
    words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.
    I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.

    The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.
    The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

    Dragon's technology is also part of the following products
    (about which I have no other info):

	Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot)
	IBM VoiceType
	Voice Navigator II (by Articulate Systems -- for Macintosh)
	EMStation (by Lanier Voice Products -- "emergency medical workstation")

    Supports: Mac, IBM PC (serial port -- native keyboard port version
    coming very soon...).  No other workstations supported, but serial
    support for Unix with X Windows has been written.  PC and Mac are
    getting all the real attention from the company.

    A chording system.  One hand is sufficient to type everything.
    The second hand is for redundancy and increased speed.

    Price:
	$495 (dual set -- each one is a complete keyboard by itself)
	$295 (single)

	(cheaper prices were offered at MacWorld Expo as a show-special.)

    Mark Roggenbuck (contact)

    Supports: PC and Mac

    Shipping: In beta.  "Big backlog" -- could take 3+ months.

    Price: $2000/unit (1 unit == 2 pods). (new price!)			    ||

    Each hand has its own "pod".  Each of the four main fingers has five
    switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have
    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles
    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is
    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod
    tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: PC (and Mac???)						    ||
    
    Planned future support:
	IBM 122-key layout (3270-style, I believe)
	Sun Sparc
	Decision Data
	Unisys UTS-40
	Silicon Graphics

	Others to be supported later.  The hardware design is relatively
	easy for the company to re-configure.

    Price: $690, including one system "personality module".		    ||

    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase
    "compatibility modules", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and
    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.

    It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the
    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each
    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  Each section
    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three
    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each
    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections
    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

    Shirley Lunde (VP Marketing -- contact)

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: PC.  Mac and Sun Sparc in the works.

    Price: $690.  Volume discounts available.  The $690 includes one foot
	pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a TypingTutor program.
	An additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.

    The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the
    keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly
    smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize
    finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,
    backspace, etc.).

    You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't
    allow the reconfig).

    Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the
    keyboard (shift, control, whatever).

    Maltron has four main products -- a two-handed keyboard, two one-handed
    keyboards, and a keyboard designed for handicapped people to control with

    The layout allocates more buttons to the thumbs, and is curved to
    bring keys closer to the fingers.  A separate keypad is in the middle.

    Doesn't use conventional push-keys.  Soft rubber keys, which rock
    forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for
    typing keys.  Learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting
    started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.

    Currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball
    is in the works.
 
    The company claims it takes about a week of work to support a
    new computer.  They will be happy to adapt their keyboard to
    your computer, if possible.

This can be caused by two one of two things.  The first and easiest to fix is
interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or
other electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix
that problem.

Second, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with
room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off
all lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not,
try moving the system somewhere else.

A third solution would be to get a 14" Apple Color Display - It should not
have the same problem the 12" Color is more suceptible to.

You can try calling Apple's new support number (in the U.S.) at 1-800-SOS-APPLE.
This number is for ANYONE who has questions regarding Macintosh setup and
compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on Monday,
April 5, 1993.

Good luck -

BUT... If you are in the habit of trying to repair old and obsolete
machines, the old data books are a goldmine of information you can
not get anywhere else. If you are trying to find a modern replacement
for an obsolete part, the original specs really come in handy. Design
out of the new books but save the old ones (or donate them to a ham).

If anybody in Phoenix disagrees, I'll drive over and help them 'get rid'
of all their old data books.

Craig-

I thought it was derived from a Greek acronym.  My Greek isn't up to much, but
it goes something like this:

	Jesus Christ, God => Iesus CHristos, THeos => Ichthos

which is the Greek for "fish" (as in, eg "ichthysaurus").

Apologies for my dreadful Greek!  Perhaps someone will correct it.

By the way, what does your sig mean?

Lines: 31

I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video
in my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13" monitor. What's
the deal on them?

1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max
and min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?

2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?

3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that
modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What
bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some
applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly
to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem?
How much slower is it?

4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was
incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT,
or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other
apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-
Microsloth) apps, for example)?

5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,
let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

Thanks a lot for you input.

Subject: Polaroid Range finder interference-Help!
Organization: /etc/organization
Lines: 26

We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. We
would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between
firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same
direction. 

To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C
5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that
corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line
of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;
we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the
time the init line of sonar B is activated. 

We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.
We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
for sonars B and C. 

Has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and
this type of experience? Your suggestions for remedies will be greatly
appreciated.

Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been

Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't
mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.
He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.
By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what 
he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not
consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more 
that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,
so the stories got bigger to appeal better.

Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who
use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because
in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are 
possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among
the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding
all other possible alternatives.

However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the 
incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at 
least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of
the other two alternative is no longer valid.

JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make

were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet

Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says 
seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for 
Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing
that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

If the first rule of humor is never having to say you're sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself.  Few things are 
worse that a joke explained.  In spite of this, and because of requests
for me to post my list o' nicknames, I must admit that no such list
exists.  It was simply a plot device, along with me being the keeper
o' the list, to make the obvious play on the last name of Fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made.

I assumed that the ol' timers would recognize it for what it is.  
Nevertheless, how about a list o' nicknames for alt.atheism posters?
If you think of a good one, just post it and see if others like it.
We could start with those posters who annoy us the most, like Bobby or
Bill.

I love the FAQ.       

The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining
correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is
this?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?

Also, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of
only about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to
95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar
with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not
be understanding all of the differences.

In the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than
with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the
intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when
necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It
is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other
consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The
first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which
glasses couldn't help. 

would not help.

Of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called Global
Positioning Satellites.  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth. 
Many surveyors use this system with a differential receiver/transmitter to get
coordinates within centimeters.  Basic receivers with resolution of a few meters (on
a good day) are available from many sources.

Who knows in this legal climate, but there is tremendous legal precendent
for forcibly quarantining TB patients in sanitariums.  100 yrs ago
it was done all the time.  It has been done sporadically all along
in patients who won't take their medicine.  If you have TB you
may find yourself under surveilence of the Public Health Department
and you may find they have the legal power to insist you make your
clinic visits.

Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound 
like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are 
common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)
which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (the
local oscillator). 

Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to
receiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must 
generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc
frequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  
The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Since
the AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...

Hi Steve,

As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your
mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this
software - the quick answer is yes! The long answer is yes - but a
few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are
the same, you know! As far as "many bugs" go, it would probably be more
useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)

Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix
Sun Solaris so it is possible.

The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the
RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear
about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to
how to fix it.

As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would
bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the
few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients
only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see
anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't
see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!

One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.
If you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for
any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,
maybe that will get results??

Robert.

****************************   SPHINX   ***************************

	Sphinx is a user-friendly, state-of-the-art image processing
and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance 
computer platforms operating UNIX and the X-Window System.

	It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists 
conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote
sensing techniques. 

		   Intuitive Graphic Interface

	Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and 
point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and
analysis simple and fast.
	This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image 
layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning
to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.

		    Image Format Compatibility

	Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open
and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real
data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats
as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.

		    Image Analysis & Processing

	For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an
assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and 
mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution 
product or principal component analyses.
An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows
the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.
Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig
onometric and transcendental functions.

		    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis

	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity
for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).
The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and
surface conditions and instrument spectral bands.
A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,
and 3-D image projection.

		    Easy External Program Interfacing

	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally
developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite
observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters
to external programs using special interface functions.

		    Quick Quality Presentation

	Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution
multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image
planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,
graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.
Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying
and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as 
histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale
output for standard inkjet and laser printers.
	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external 
graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?

		    Software Support & Development

	 Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)
 of the Universite de Lille, France.
The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at
the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),
and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).
At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing
research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features
on-line help, is supported by an Internet address

 sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and
 version updates provided without delay.

		    Performance Tested

 	CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data 
collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today,
the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center
and is widely used in many French laboratories, including
the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure ,
Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire 
de Meteorologie Dynamique.


   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr
   (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)

   IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE. HOWEVER THE
   VISUALISATION AND GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS IS
   SUFFICIENT TO WORK WITH.

   IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KEEPING "SPHINX", SEND US YOUR EMAIL
   AND YOU WILL RECEIVE NEWS ABOUT THE PACKAGE EVOLUTION.

   THE SOFTWARE IS CHANGING WITH USER SUGGESTIONS WE WILL
   APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS.

Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed
face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular
pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in
the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are
sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,
one can get too much of a good thing.

>Some reacted with headache, 

Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased
heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,
essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency
her, necessarily.


>some stomach ache.

Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not
necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting
occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has
eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the
list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an
enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly
ache) would be expected.


> Some had watery eyes or running nose,


These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar
to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious
compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible
some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the
symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets
can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be
necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person
was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration
and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from
simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.
 
> some
>had itchy skin or rashes. 

People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends
upon what it is about the compound that "pisses off" their body.
Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many
people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an
histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,
causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an
allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that
contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can
perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. 

>More serious accusations include respiration 
>difficulty 

See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory
problems are not serious. They can be deadly.

and brain damage. 

The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system
controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling
the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,
and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.


>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food
poisoning. 

Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,
say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus
too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,
plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days
before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of
things.

But it might be the MSG. 

>if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.

If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably
stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.


Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their
responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.

Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events,
calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue
that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I
just question whether you >should<.

The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we
can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That
has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human
perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't
think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather
that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.

I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models
that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I
really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.

> There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal
> image compression.

Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal
compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so
great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't,
I'll wager.

Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression
work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable
alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)

I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I
don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is
practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their
sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a
real product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,
right?

	"There are always going to be questions until there's a product

I think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be
suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression.  There is
no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy
person.  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may
even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I
certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.

To address your more general question, IV therapy does provide higher and
more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug.  For treating a
serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is
getting adequate drug levels.

===== This is a posting for my friend who does not have USENET access ========
===== Please contact him (not me) directly, thank you ========================

1. The Mac II is supposed to have a socket for the MC68851 PMMU chip. Could
anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard. I have obtained
a PMMU chip (16 Mhz) from a surplus store, and would like to install it onto
my Mac II (circa 1987). But I cannot see the socket myself when I tried to
install it.

2. Could anyone send me the pinouts for the Mac II SCSI DB-25 interface?


Thank you.

The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to
one of the hot questions of the day ('77).  He really had very little
reason to believe it, other than raw hope.  By fantasy, I certainly don't
mean Velikovskian manias.

I'm not familiar with the history of this experiment, although, arguably,
I should be.

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising.
That's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's
reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons,
but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be
impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if
it is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone
rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has
discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never
publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are
right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for
anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous
reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at
a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).

Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the
fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right
in the end.

Yes, I remember that now.  Well, in that case, the cones are indeed

Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine.
It can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage.
An odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine.
People with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything
else rich in phenylalanine.

Aspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptoms.
Pat Robertson's program _The_700_Club_ was beating the drum against
aspartame rather vigorously for about a year, but that issue seems to
have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so.  Apparently,
the evidence is not very strong, or Pat would still be flailing away.

You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings
I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem... at _any_ speed.  Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture, or something.  I'm vague on the
details, but the gist was that there are going to be no
third-party internal Duo modems.  If I'm wrong, somebody please
correct me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

Sunny,

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on 
it's side.  I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I 
trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the 
least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you 
have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on 
it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I 
don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S 
internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen - it freezes.

I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
startup.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured
twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time.

Anyone out there with these same problems?

Nope, this won't work for a cylinder. You can have a line arbitrarily close

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works
very well.  That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it
because of its complexity.

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making
some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF
images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general
inability to interchange images between different environments
despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.

As the saying goes, "It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the
>other<  assholes out there!"  I've had big trouble with misuse and
abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and
unnecessary) complexity of the format.

In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized
emphasis mine):

"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed
to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a
fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in
this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),
and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be
able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many
image-generating applications out there now."


If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF
image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to
deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I
don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not
that anyone does, of course! :-)

Hmm, USENET got it's collective hooks into me around 1987 or so right after I

So, will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade, or will it 
require a logic board swap? It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I 
guess that's getting a bit fantastic!

I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card.

Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the 
estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true.

Finally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it 
advertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it's
at all *interesting*.

Hi,
Could some kind soul post me the max power/voltage/current ratings of
2SC1096 and 2SA634 transistors, their conductance types and pinouts.
They are used in the sweep portion of a TV set.
Thanks in advance,

In the UIBM PC world, how much of a "standard" has VESA become for
SVGA graphics?  I know there are lots of graphics-board companies out 
there, as well as several graphics chips manufacturers- are they adhering to
the VESA standard, and what effect is/will the VESA Local Bus have on all
of this?
Anyone?

Yeah, of course... The term 'mach banding' was not the correct one, it should've
been 'color quantization effect'. Although a bad color quantization effect could
result in some visible mach-bands on a picture that was smooth before it was
quantizised.

I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities
to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and
use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software,
_DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551
with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).

Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_
stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may
get only a half byte...

The IIIP has just been superseded by the 4M, which is the one I am using at

Listen: thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics.  If you have thrush, you have thrush, because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it, it generally
responds well, if you're not otherwise immunocompromised.  Noring's
anal-retentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here, nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have "candida" from reading a quack book.

Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator? There are a few Unix versions

One for Mach (NeXT) and for Irix (SGI). There may be others, such

Subject: HELP - SCSI Woes on Mac IIfx
Keywords: SCSI, IIfx
Organization: NASA Ames Research Center 
Lines: 46

I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old
and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for
two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining
5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.
The error message reported was like:

Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.

This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the
diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after
reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes
2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,
but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall
System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,
I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:

   o Frequent crashes
   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to
       correct.
   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.
       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the
         disk either.
       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes
         requires several attempts.

QUESTIONS:

   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?
   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard
      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some
      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?
   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest
      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the
      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx
      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal
      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with
      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).
      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;
      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of
      course who knows :-<

Help would be much appreciated.

Be sure to say "chronic" dizziness, not just dizziness.  Most
patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better.
The vertiginous spells of Meniere's will also eventually go
away, however, the patient is left with a deaf ear.

This may have helped you, but I'm not sure it is good general
advice.  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with
your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge
for this or any other disease are slim.  When good answers to these
problems are found, it is usually in all the newspapers.  Until
then, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical
problem may divert that energy from more productive things
in life.  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself
that your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes
clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine
has no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join
the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to
make a career out of it.

Surprise surprise, different people react differently to different things. One
slightly off the subject case in point. My brother got stung by a bee. I know
he is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localized
swelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that,
however, because that's not written in their little rule book.

I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad
reactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting. Not that
the stuff is BAD or POISON and needs to be banned, but people need to be aware
that it can have a bad effect on SOME people.

courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and 
Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses 
each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin 
June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours 
per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  
Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact 
Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology
Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or
address below.  
ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and 
January 1994.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:

1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time.

2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,
Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.


3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,
and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.
So at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don't
think that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice.

Subject: Questions about Plane Eqn method of Hidden Surface removal
Organization: The Cellar BBS and public access system
Lines: 18

What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and
the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which
requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns
whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn
method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several
comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the
transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the
screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My
method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the
screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of
something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so
merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are
looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this
method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.

It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the
disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's
memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible
with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written
Is that correct?

Summary: some CView problems explained
Keywords: Stupid Programming
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]

A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.
Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post
it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:

CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most
annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to
do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control
over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its
"current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)
when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView
doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems 
to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour
information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writing
another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this
second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does
the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to
your screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its
"fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)

 The result of this process is the following:
  
     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all
        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of
        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never
        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.

     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for
        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the
        dithering and writes to the screen card.
        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data
        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)
        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which
        there was room on the disk.

This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general
idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details
about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient
disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be
very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess
of 6 Meg free disk space.


CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from
a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the
floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT
table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted
floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly
unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a
program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files
menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the
hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once
when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to
sort a directory listing?


With much thanks to the originator of this article.

Thought it means Global Positioning System. There are two precision levels, one  
for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  
ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  
though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with  
an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the  
same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  
then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  
You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  
Your original signals. So the GPS system seems to be the better (and running)  
idea for Your application(there have been discussions in this newsgroup, don't  
know of an address anymore).

Larry:

The subject content IS serious; as is the question.

On one hand you state that "things have changed dramatically" but, at the
same time nothing you "can think of has changed".  Your girlfriend seems
to want to see a counselor, but you don't.  

I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor.  It's
a very good environment to examine issues.  

The fact of the matter is:  your girlfriend has a different perception than
you.  The TWO of you need to address the issue in order to resolve it.

Please consider going to a counselor with your girlfriend.  What could it
possibly hurt?

>Hmmm.  How are those orange "isolated ground" outlets (often used in

They require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin
of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's
mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal
faceplate, if any).

The box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.
The outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated
busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to
the building-entrance main ground by its own wire.

So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the
building's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every
grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,
while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged
into isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens
to accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,
the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it
until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated
ground will remain relatively noise-free.

I missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or

If line level, there's a single chip 4x1 *stereo* audio switch available
that switches 4 two-channel inputs into 1 two-channel output, and also
has a mute function, all controllable with ttl inputs.  LM1037, I think?

That's a typical claim, though they say they've improved
compression speed considerably.  Did you find out anything else
about the book?  I'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me
any pointers.

Reportedly, early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used
that marvelous piece of hardware called "grad students" to do the
work.  Supposedly it's been automated since about 1988, but I'm still
waiting to be impressed.

You apparently have trouble reading things you don't like. The point was
having sex the way one wishes being a strong desire. Marriage is a red

that doesn't fit into the world as you would like to have it.

Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:

"Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?"

Here's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor
in it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much
power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How
does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing
PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a
unique ability to give users that 040 power in a "Semi-Portable" fashion.
By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk.
On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.
Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)
So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in
parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical
now...

Wouldn't this require a hyper-sphere.  In 3-space, 4 points over specifies
a sphere as far as I can see.  Unless that is you can prove that a point
exists in 3-space that is equi-distant from the 4 points, and this may not
necessarily happen.

Correct me if I'm wrong (which I quite possibly am!)

From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:
 
"Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would
remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For
instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another
simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a
plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the
contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if
there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to
determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be
established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what
is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then
they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor
can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding
content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in
virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to
action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may
talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim
that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left
of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may
well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements
with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion
is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have
preferences regarding human activity."

The market size for color quickdraw for accellerated plusses and

Several years ago I tried to commit a patient who was growing Salmonella out of his
stool, blood, and an open ulcer for treatment. The idea was that the guy was a
walking public health risk, and that forcing him to receive IV antibiotics for
a few days was in the public interest. I will make a long story short by saying
that the judge laughed at my idea, yelled at me for wasting his time, and let
the guy go.

I found out that tuberculosis appears to be the only MEDICAL (as oppsed to psychiatric)
condition that one can be committed for, and this is because very specific laws were
enacted many years ago regarding tb. I am certain these vary from state to state.

1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the

I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting). 
My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly
infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your
acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g.,
paint programs).

In a nutshell, I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is

Not to drag this out anymore, but....

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that
in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs
presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.

A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs
can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been
an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements
for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.
Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to "prove" that
the disease exists.

This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:

1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs
had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5
months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further
clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So
these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous
recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations
longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't
have the same chronicity that some see in humans.

2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the
vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want
the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine
efficacy.

Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations
of this vaccine in the next year or so.

The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps.
There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control
of NI, like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump (I was
appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast). It is my
understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water --
it'd be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain and

life. If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent
that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must 
leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law
but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.

In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam
are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect
the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state 
laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws
on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving)
etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military
protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.

After the Fatwa didn't Rushdie re-affirm his faith in Islam, didn't
he go thru' a very public "conversion" to Islam? If so he is binding
himself to Islamic Laws. He has to publicly renounce in his belief in Islam
so the burden is on him.

  I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a 
NuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color 
is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan
rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it
can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
software control panel.

  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw 
calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing
up the mac processor for other tasks. 

  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night
was $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just
over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the
original manuals.

  Hurry!

There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always gives,
before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his
new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times
in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over 
2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief
of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his
program.

In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly 
written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which
I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also
*greatly* improved in other areas as well.

Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to
molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus
since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000
question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was
from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.

BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.

In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee
their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned.

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many
cases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in
the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per
seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the
signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit
convertor is more then sufficient.

AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases
you are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled
also. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If
the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly
distorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the
occurrence of the spike that is important. 

However, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start
battling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were
to start looking for the technical specifications.

A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was
discovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia
was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a
"plug and patch".

The doctor considered the procedure a success.

A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that
he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.

Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any
specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure
now says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and he
said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.

My question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to
determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from
something else?

Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped
myself and a few others:

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't
rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). 
Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache?

I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some
operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses?

Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above.

Subject: 3d GrafSys 1.21 in incoming directory
A 3d GrafSys short description follows:

Programmers 3D GrafSys Vers 1.21 now available. 

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION
NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for
C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free 
to contact me.
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from
the FPU version to make it run faster.

Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.

********

Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:
-------------------------------------

Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing three-dimensional scenes? 

Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of three-dimensional molecules?

And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it?

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to 
do with this package???' , read on.

GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines 
for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating 
(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) 
three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.

GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on). 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)

GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above 
processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.
Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D
graphics and how to use the package.

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. 
However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.

GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.


Enjoy,
Christian Franz

The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system
7 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC?  I
recall there being a conversation here that a 486/25 running Windows benchmarks
at about the same speed as 25Mhz 030 in system 7.  I don't know if that is
true, but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.

Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get 
documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even 
support of some small degree.  Whatever you want to offer that is "better" 
than the circulating version.

It doesn't really hurt legit users.  Shareware is still much cheaper than

FMGs who are not citizens are, like all aliens, in a difficult
situation. Only citizens get to vote here, so non-citizens are of
little or no interest to legislators. Also, the non-citizen may well
be in the middle of processing for resident alien status. There is a
stron sense that rocking the boat (eg. suing a residency program)
will delay the granting of that status, perhaps for ever.

This is indeed one function, but more sophisticated ones do level control

Simple ones are just that - a transformer. A decent quality audio trans-
former will cost most of that $50. They are wired thus...

The ground-lift switch disconnects the GND line from the mixer. The
transformer ratio depends on the precise application, but around 10:1
turns ratio may be a good place to start.

Subject: Axion Serial port switcher: Good or bad?
Organization: Drexel University
Lines: 26

Hi!

   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has
two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound
digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)

   Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it
seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)

   Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these
things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you
from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs
that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?

   Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you
think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would
like to spend under $140, if possible.

   Please reply through mail; I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.
If there's interest, I can post a summary of replies.

Thanks a lot!

Most likely the tragic situation in Bosnia is a combination of ethnical
and religious motives, where religion is just one attribute that separates
the groups from each other.

But I must agree that the sad saga in Bosnia is a terrible example
of a case where religion is not helping, instead it is used as a weapon
against other humans. And my sympathies are mostly on the Bosnian side,
it looks like the Serbs are the oppressors, willing to use even
Christianity as a weapon against their former friends.

Cheers,

If this theory were true, the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy
(evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units); it doesn't.
Instead, the biopsy shows scattered, angulated, atrophic fibers.
This is more consistent with load-shedding by chronically overworked
motor neurons - the neurons survive, at the expense of increasingly
denervated muscle.

An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE/30 is that,
just as with the '030 power cache, the '040 accelerator will plug into
the CPU socket, leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet
card.  With DayStar's upgrade path, it's a no lose situation.

The screws are Torx screws and the tool isn't to hard to find. It's a

No it is not a good idea to take that fan out.  Why because it will

Tenderizing beef involves sprinking or marinading it in papain, an enzyme.
"Meat tenderizer" packets might contain papain and MSG and seasonings, but
MSG doesn't act as a tenderizer.

Infantile spasms have been well understood for quite some time now.  You
are seeing a pediatric neurologist, aren't you?  If not, I strongly
recommend it.  There is a new anticonvulsant about to be released called
felbamate which may be particularly helpful for infantile spasms.  As
for learning more about seizures, ask your doctor or his nurse about a
local support group.

How do you spell "tuna helper" ? 

I gather by off-shore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
blue-fin tuna's who are into that squid-fi sound?  (I agree on that one). 
My Adcom 555 preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
"running the chips class "A" resistor mod", and replacing the metal 
bottom cover with plexiglass,, too bad the factory could not make em sound 
better,, but better sound, unfortunately, does not appear to be a priority

have improved what was already touted as superlative state-o-d-art le'sound. 
I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
from an sp9II (even an sp3a!) to a GFP-555/etc., or maybe from those that 
have dumped their forte' amps for a GFA-555/etc....

I don't care what gay people do among each other, as long as they don't make
passes at me or anything.  At my summer camp where I work, my boss is gay.
Not in a 'pansy' way of gay (I know a few), but just 'one of the guys'.
He doesn't push anything on me, and we give him the same respect back, due
to his position.

If anything, the BSA has taught me, I don't know, tolerance or something.
Before I met this guy, I thought all gays were 'faries'.  So, the BSA HAS
taught me to be an antibigot.

Basically, It comes down to this: What you do among yourself is your own

There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
Transactions On Graphics. I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors. Sorry not to be more specific. I don't have the
reference here with me.

The article actually was more general than this, giving a way to decide
whether a given (cubic) Bezier curve contains cusps, intersection points
or whatever wierdness. The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH 89
course notes for the course called "Math for Siggraph" or something like
that.

characters on a Sun station.  I am trying to convert a fortran program to run
on a Sun.  When we write character buffers to the Sun which contain char(218)
or char(196) or char(197) etc.  We get characters on the screen but they are
not the characters in the standard ASCII tables.

Any ideas or help will be appreciated.

     I am doing a term paper on steroids, actually the scientist who
helped crate the drug. I discovered that Joseph Fruton is one of the
researchers who helped create anabolic steroids. The only information on 
this person I know is he was a biochemist that did research in the 1930's.
I already did research at my local libraries, but I still need more

Sometimes.  It depends on your monitor and your timing.  If you don't
have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can
get even/odd tearing at the top of the screen, which is very sensitive
to the HHOLD control.  It looks like what you would expect if you
scanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the
upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube. 
With proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock
solid.

      Well, I've now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board
 since 9pm.  It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can
 drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the
 6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem
 1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the
 other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper
 (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It 
would
 shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also I've 
been
 trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried 
PNP's,
 still NO LUCK!!!  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel
 my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!
         I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220 
pkg
 type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.

                         I'm going to try getting some z's, and I hope 
you
 can help me with this problem.
   If someone can please help me with this soon, it would be greatly
   appreciated...

                 Thanks.

KS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome
KS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg
KS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information

I'm not sure that this condition is "recognised" anywhere (in the
sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries
between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic
features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.

Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease
by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities
are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of
ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of
declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.
Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless
contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows
muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old
denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit
action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation
(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation
with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active
denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme
staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.

Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically
evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,
the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one
year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio
before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among
polio survivors than among people who never had polio.

The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little
evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or
destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.

There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have
anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,
motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than
patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.
Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason
for these "acute" changes in a "chronic" disease (old polio) is
unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge
numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several
years.

There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio
syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny
deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe
polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.
They also tend to score higher on depression scales of
neuropsychologic tests.

My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from
severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,
ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or
degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing
pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads
to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am
perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS
patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe
that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than
non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but
without PPS complaints).

Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $25
per floptical (= $1.20 per megabyte), and I have seen them advertised
in MacWEEK at $20 (< $1.00 per megabyte).  For someone on a tight

Science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed
interpretations of our observations (perceptions).

Values can also refer to meaning.  For example in computer science the
value of 1 is TRUE, and 0 is FALSE.  Science is based on commonly agreed
values (interpretation of observations), although science can result in a
reinterpretation of these values.

The values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been
fully agreed, and the change with time.  The values of Newtonian physic are
certainly different to those of Quantum Mechanics.

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument
against extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some
truth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a
_plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this
stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or
anything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you
all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot
of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to
gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.  

Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is "a prime cause"
(in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological
problems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying
it is "the prime cause" or "the only cause", just "a prime cause" --
i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when
you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I
admit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that
extra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family)
is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like
depression in Western society this century.

I have written a program and I want to market it.  I would like certain degree
of protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the 
cooperations.   I know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method,
however, my  software is going to cost only $15.00, so I can not afford that.
Also, at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my
software. Well, I guess say upto %20 illigal copying is ok by me.

However, I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software.  
Off course, I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying, since they
can develope a better program anyway.

Yes, I did punch in the wrong numbers (working too many late nites).  I

This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.


The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable
analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible
and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.

Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories,
and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran
is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that
this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the
Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,
("forty days and forty nights", "pair of every animal", etc.), we all
know this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is
so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as "A big river 
flooded for a few days and caused much damage".  Yes, no contradiction
but also not much fact.

The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being
consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that
time, does not seem much of an achievement.

The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had
divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot
of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them
can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by
talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.

The above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.

Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a "bad"
experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in
a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was
told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return
the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for
returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.

Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were
ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me "Why we never
received your old chips."  I then explained I the procedure that I had
followed to return them, to which the person replied "You mean you sent them
US Mail?" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly
what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were
absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted
to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to
TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)
Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them
to "make it right."

I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking
them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously
appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with
the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of
knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths
to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never
buy another product from them again.

(like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also...

you can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)...
also animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds)

you get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)...

I have a (very old) Mac 512k and a Mac Plus, both of which 
have the same problem.

Their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt
(such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes 
all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank).

I have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the 
video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires
made the screen come back on.  This worked for a while, but the
blanking out has returned.

Can I do anything?  Do I need a new power supply?  A new CRT?
A new computer?

Thanks for any advice...

Hi there!

I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display
card for driving a 14" multisync (NEC 3D)?
The NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and
vertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,
though I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624
noninterlaced.
It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite
freely within these limits and is capable to display at least
8bits/pixel, preferably more.

Is there anything on the market that comes even close?


Thanks

But you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return.  This

made from the pro-Christian people.  I've known several Jesuits who would
laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.

Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice
word Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the
liar, lunatic part.

The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands
of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there,
but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many
thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the 
Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all
the time, but look at the number of follower they have.

As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.  He was obviously insane,
his advisors certainly thought so.  Yet he had a whole country entralled
and came close to ruling all of Europe.  How many Germans gave their lives
for him?  To this day he has his followers.

I'm just amazed that people still try to use this argument.  It's just
so obviously *wrong*.

This is in fact a hot topic in medicine these days, and much of the
medical literature is devoted to this.  The most heavily funded studies
these days are for outcome research, and physicians (and others!) are
constantly questionning whether what we do it truly effective in any given

are even entire publications devoted to QA issues.

Sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as well
as induce primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise the abdominal swelling could be
due to a complication of Sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which *can* produce
a splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). She should definitely see a rheumatologist.

Since you don't mention skin disorder, anemia, or joint pain you'd probably
rule out erythema nodosum or scleroderma.

No, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common
forms of meningitis.  It's the one that sometimes sweeps
schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking
the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose
and the brain to swell up.

It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time,
however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible
to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who
becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where
a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also
occur.

It can live in the throat of carriers.  Don't worry, you won't get 
it from them, especially if they took the medication.

This posting is totally uncalled for in rec.scouting.

The point has been raised and has been answered.  Roger and I have
clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue;
specifically, that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of
the Scout Oath (specifically, the promise to live "morally straight").

There is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue
with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless
because it's like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can't
control their race but they can control their behavior).

What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue?
Nobody, including BSA, is denying anybody the right to live and/or
worship as they please or don't please,  but it doesn't mean that BSA
is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious
and moral standards on which our society has been established and on
which it should continue to be based.

Wait a minute.  I thought you said that Allah (I presume Allah == God) was unknowable,

You say that God does not have a "face".  Doesn't the bible say that God has hindparts?

I'll probably get flamed for this, but when I was a kid we would go to
my uncles cabin on Middle Bass Island on Lake Erie. We always came home
with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had
burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear
finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The
application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of
the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution
though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.

(If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me
toast.:)

Subject: outlining of spline surface
Keywords: spline rasterization
Lines: 38


	About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to
be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if
anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published 
solutions to it.

	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two
roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially
starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant
between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw 
the object we 

1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively
	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the
        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume
	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not
	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable
	measure.
2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment
	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two
	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.
3) Depth sort the triangles
4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw
	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is
	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge
	colored with a special "edge color"

	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the
problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.
The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in
the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.
They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting
from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem
sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this
area.

I haven't been following this, so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  
this, but you could grab a lemon (I think potatoes work too, but I'm not  
sure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (I think you can get the  
metal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  Stick the strips in  
the lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not  
a lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  As I recall we had to hook  
something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
current, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a  
demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)

Recent discussion about XV's problems were held in some newsgroup.
Here is some text users of XV might find interesting.
I have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even
you so my articles a while ago.

I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can, so fine
program XV is that it is worth of improving.
(I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV, e-mail me for them.)

Note that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that
the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality.
Also, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality
depends on them too.
 
This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.
 
IMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusing
errors in programs.
There's two errors:
  -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the
   original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of
   original 24bit should be a special case
  -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer
   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the
   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier
   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases
   in saving the image, if at all)
 
==clip==

==clip==

[ ..deleted..]

It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design.
It is error in design.
It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs;
jpeg is not designed to that.

As matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were
known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only
at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the
whole design should be changed to support 24bit images.
That were not done and now we have
 -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)
 -the program has human interface errors.

Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without
clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.

[ ..deleted.. ]

==clip==

Some new items follows.

==clip==

I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24
option than with default option we have.
The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)
the same than used in ppmquant.

If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found
that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv
(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly
-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.

I don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.
So, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.

I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in
rlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.
(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I
can say nothing about it.)

==clip==

==clip==

Some minor bugs in human interface are:

Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens
that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong
place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about
five minutes and then it is gone away immediately.
The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.

Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard
and mouse for XV after the image is completed.
Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when
I'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings
then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.

In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV
updates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first
and then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be
updated when the setting are not ready yet.
I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a "character" containing
all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  This
means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.  There is no special way to
detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there's no magic signal
generated by UARTs, etc.

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs.

A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are
three inputs required.

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low).

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines.

Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders.

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

Well, this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over
into alt.atheism, where we spend most of our time entertaining
arguments against our belief system, without resorting to accusing
others of bigotry.  It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry
happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I
always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I
understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who
happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or
other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen
indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are
exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further
evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people
are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are
discriminatory.

and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. 
The screen would probably be monochrome.
The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very
popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word
processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient
to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and
applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could
hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.

Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really
need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me
via email and let me know:
1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen
2. How much you would be willing to pay for it
3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea

Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,
but who knows!), please send me some.

Thanks in advance!!!

I don't think there is really any question about which god the courts
mean.  The request for solemnly swearing, so help you god,
 is always made after a request to pick up the bible in your left hand
and hold up your right hand.  In the courts of NC, at least, it is always
an old and new testament.

Though it is hard to imagine, picking up the bible and swearing to (whatever)
god is sometimes the least of the religious influence.  There is a court in
Greensboro, NC, where the judge routinely has everyone in the courtroom
stand to join him in prayer at the beginning of every session.  I've thought about
sitting through it, but I'm not terribly anxious to spend 30 days in jail...

You probably mean "RoHypnol", a member of the benzodiazepine family,
chemical name is flunitrazepam. It is such a strong tranquilizer that it is
probably best refered to as a hypnotic, rather than a tranquilizer. Just one
pill will knock you on your ass. Side effects may be similar to valium, xanax,
serax, librium and other benzodiazepines.

There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which 
come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with 
differing amounts of VRAM on them.  The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are 
organized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them.  This is 
the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.

Two.

Both SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does 
nothing for you.

80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.

There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible 
with the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you 
get them from guarantees compatiblity.  In general, if it works in a Q950,
it will work in a Q800.

Recently, my video monitor went dead, no picture, some low distorted sound.
I didn't hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated HV at work, nor are the
filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing.

On examining the power board, I noticed the largest capacitor with a very
bad bulge at the top.  Naturally, I want to replace it, but I can't find
any sources.

The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is
roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8" wide.  The dimensions are important since
the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.

Living in the Los Angeles area, I've been to numerous stores (Dow Radio,
All Electronics, ITC Elect, Sandy's, Yale Elect) with empty hands.

Can anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors?  Mail order is 
fine, although I'd rather check out a store to compare the can.  I'm going
to try a video electronics store, hopefully they'll have HV caps.

(By the way, the monitor is a ATARI SC1224, Goldstar circuitry, Masushita
tube.  Anyone else had problems?)

Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.  Re-writing more carefully, we have
(at least) two possibilities.  The first:

Things called "Mercedes" are cars
That girl is called "Mercedes"
Therefore that girl is a car

That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction.  It is not sound,
because the first statement is false.  Similarly, I would hold that Jim's
example is valid but not sound.

Another possible interpretation of what you wrote is:

There exists at least one car called "Mercedes"
That girl is called "Mercedes"
Therefore that girl is a car

-- which isn't valid.

Ah, but why?  Can some technically-hip Macslinger tell us what the

Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a

  I answer from the position that we would indeed place these people
  in prison for life.

  That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but
  also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability
  to commit the same crimes again.

  In other words, if lifetime imprisonment doesn't work, perhaps
  it's not because we're not executing these people, but because
  we're not being careful enough about how we lock them up.

Reply-To: behr@math.ilstu.edu (Eric Behr)
Organization: Central Illinois Surfing Club
Lines: 31

I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC
adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the
newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.

The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -
specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac
tests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, the
power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use
the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the
Asante box pretty much unusable.

It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn
on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed
during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter
works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has
*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had
it for over a year).

Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --
several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the
head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator
(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal
resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another
identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?
Thanks a lot.    E.

So hard atheism has nothing to prove?  Then how does it justify that
God does not exist?  I know, there's the FAQ, etc.  But guess what -- if
those justifications were so compelling why aren't people flocking to
_hard_ atheism?  They're not, and they won't.  I for one will discourage
people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable
statements on hard atheism.

If there is truly no alternative, then you have no basis whatsoever

that you have no alternative, no possible basis for the claim that
there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in
religious knowledge, except possibly that reason conflicts with
"religious knowledge".

This sounds very much like "I can't provide a rational defense for my

may be false".  I hope it makes you happy, but your repeated and
unfounded assertions to this effect don't advance your cause.

with other drugs or in a kind of AIDS  treatment "cocktail" combining a number 
of drugs to fight the  virus all at once.  "Treating people with AZT alone 
doesn't  happen in the real world anymore," said Dr. Mark Jacobson of the  
University of California--San Francisco.  Also, with recent  findings 
indicating that HIV replicates rapidly in the lymph  nodes after infection, 
physicians may begin pushing even harder  for early treatment of HIV-infected 
patients.

     The Center for Disease Control will launch a worldwide network to track 
the spread of infectious diseases and detect drug-resistant or new strains in 
time to help prevent their spread.  The network is expected to cost between 
$75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton 
administration's health reform  plan, according to the CDC and outside 
experts.  The plan will  require the CDC to enhance surveillance of disease in 
the United  States and establish about 15 facilities across the world to  
track disease.

     The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start  treating 
HIV-positive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion, resulting 
from recent findings that show HIV is  active in the body in large numbers 
much earlier than was  previously believed.  Anthony Fauci, director of the 
U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, 
"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly 
can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will 
get around microbial resistance."  He said any delay would signify questions 
over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-
authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  
argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery 
indicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time 
and money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were 
infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of 
Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument 
for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the 
new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand 
the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  "We've known about this 
for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain," said Jesse 
Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who  
believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the 
West, said, "We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even 
if these papers are right."

"Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal" Washington Post 
(04/14/93), P. A9 

     The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care  
professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding 
supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of 
contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the 
JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive 
surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies 
were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and 
Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and 
tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found 
that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  
HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131 
patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital 
were found to be HIV-negative.  Similarly  in Florida, 900 of 1,192 dental

patients, who all had been  treated by an HIV-positive general dentist, were 
tested and found to be negative for HIV.  The Florida researchers, led by 
Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said, 
"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general 
dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal 
precautions are strictly observed."   Related Story: Philadelphia Inquirer

"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program" AIDS 
Treatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) 

     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of 
Health has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses 
unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of 
the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 
billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available 
research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be 
available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for 
Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid 
to become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is no 
easy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that the 
OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, 
such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an 
advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS 
community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' 
general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic 
will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisory 
panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  
will take them several years to accept the nature of research."   
Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator 
at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is a 
wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the 
Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much 
more [than  public relations]."

"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, 
No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) 

     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-
6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack 
causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in 
the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a 
factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  
found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, 
which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can

kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural 
killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  
research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural 
killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony 
L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube 
findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the 
body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  
molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface 
receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that 
herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.

     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only 
ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health 
problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert 
and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, 
Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  
respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care 
about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for 
the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should 
be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it 
is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  
respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic 
development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  
Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have 
on many developing countries, and the increased need for international 
assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political 
aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there 
is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach 
to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in 
particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in the 
Balance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable 
international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child 
survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the 
developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  
change the future of worldwide health.

     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible 
before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less 
attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller 
Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and 
Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as 
malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  
economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention 
than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is 
receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most 
developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic 
diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another 
year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS 
and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden 
but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a 
rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each 
individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley 
says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  
economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he 
concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the 
United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries 
with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  
has been the rule.

            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children
                                H H S   N E W S

        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children


The National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental 
HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. 

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 
children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-
infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. 

HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a 
hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected 
children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS." 

Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "is 
the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay 
disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If these 
vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their 
therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in 
the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health 
Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. 

The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which 
funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial 
at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the 
ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development. 

Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows 
that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and

stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers 
know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. 

The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined 
closely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insight 
into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," said 
Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  "We need this 
information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent 
HIV infection in children." 

In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city 
areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. 

Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during 
pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than 
a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing 
numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection 
drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding 
increase in the numbers of infected children. 

HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  
The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV 
develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These 
infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of 
childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms 
leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. 

At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger 
to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older 
participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no 
symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen 
liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-
regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. 

Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical 
School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of 
Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical 
officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. 

"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children 
for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or 
fevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "We'll also look at 
whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other 
significant laboratory or clinical effects."   He emphasized that the small 
study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three

products. 

The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from 
recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically 
engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-
tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. 

One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a 
protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  
Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is 
the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 

Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco 
and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in 
Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus 
adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine 
contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in 
other Phase I vaccine trials in adults. 

A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 
children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the 
experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, 
considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will 
be told what they receive. 

If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the 
experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will 
begin. 

Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six 
months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

           NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE HIV CAN CAUSE DISEASE INDEPENDENTLY
              News from the National Institute of Dental Research

There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease 
independently of its ability to suppress the immune system, say scientists at 
the National Institues of Health. 

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling 
skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the 
HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' 
immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV 
itself caused the skin disease. 

Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease 
without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the 
National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues 
described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human 
Retroviruses. 

Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most 
animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this 
problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for 
HIV as well as their own genetic material. 

NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse 
eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters 
contained both normal and transgenic animals. 

Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV 
genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon 
after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an 
incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. 

Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their 
necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin 
lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No 
skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. 

Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a 
type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can 
cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the 
animals. 

Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the 
presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned 
on," or active, said Dr. Kopp. 

The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the 
mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common 
infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune 
systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the 
skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. 

Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists 
exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV 
genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  
Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the 
genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No 
lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. 

The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter 
Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases. 

Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. 
Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; 
Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, 
formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS

                 ********************************************
                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                                 March 4, 1993


     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide 
clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care 
professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV 
infection or AIDS. 
     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a 
physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on 
drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is 
funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of 
San Francisco General Hospital. 
     Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertise 
so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health 
care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces 
treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and 
community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients 
with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience." 
     Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especially 
helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in 
communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available." 
     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and 
it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) 
Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer 
questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and 
health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be 
answered as quickly as possible. 
     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question 
related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment 
information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, 
literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health 
care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate 
sources of information or materials. 
     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken 
by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse 
practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and 
inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant 
asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current 
medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. 
     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern 
California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health 
Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and 
by the American Academy of Family Physicians. 
     "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of 
care they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA Administrator 
Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource for 
health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve." 
     "This service has opened a new means of communication between health care 
professionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSA's associate 
administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources 
Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  "Providers who treat people with 
HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment 
methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS." 
     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.

And you know why this is? Because you've conveniently _defined_ a theist as
someone who can do no wrong, and you've _defined_ people who do wrong as
atheists. The above statement is circular (not to mention bigoting), and,
as such, has no value.

That's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on
how to act, it is evil.  Atheism is not a moral system, so why should
it speak of instructions on how to act?  *Atheism is simply lack of
belief in God*.

  Plenty of theists

I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide
can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide.
This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act,
and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.  However, since
the atheist set of instructions is the null set, how can you show that
atheism causes genocide?

You know, it just occurred to me today that this whole Christian thing
can be blamed solely on Mary.

So, she's married to Joseph.  She gets knocked up.  What do you think
ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up
with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.  Actually, it
can't be all THAT ridiculous, considering the number of people that
believe it.  Anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells
poor little Jesus that he's hot shit, the Son of God.  Everyone else
tells him this too, since they've bought Mary's story.  So, what does
Mary actually turn out to be?  An adultress and a liar, and the cause of
mankind's greatest folly...

Just my recently-minted two cents.

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.

  I've talked with Mark and he faxed some literature, though it wasn't very helpful-
  just a list of routine names: _BSplineSurface, _DrawString3D... 241 names.
  There was a Product Info sheet that explained some of the package capabilities.

We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on  
Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent  
Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to  
encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our  
three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  
that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.


On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  
will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  
awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.

Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  
characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  
trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  
lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   
Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  
last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  
lifetime.  

Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  
of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  
Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  
support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  
newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  
in the prevention, cure, and treatment.

Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  
those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  
were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  
attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  
Foundation's mission is to change that. 

Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  
Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  
Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  
Princeton, or sent directly to:

			The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation

Yes, but... shouldn't size of newsgroup be an issue?  Sorry if this
has been covered before, but comp.grahpics.animation get how much 
traffic per day?  50 articles?  Maybe 70 on an extremely heavy day?
I've been following this group for about four months now, and I don't
recall ever seeing such a flood of posts that a split would be warranted.

That's not true.    I gave you two examples.   One was the rather
pevasive anti-semitism in German Christianity well before Hitler
arrived.   The other was the system of social ranks that were used
in Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest 
of the population.

Neither of these were very terrible in themselves, but both helped
to set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of Jews
was made easier.

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of
the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though "accepted", may
not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick
buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is
significantly inflated by these "quacks of a different color".  In fact, I'd
say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the
true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus
on these "quacks" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and-
destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.


***************************************************
Now to make a general comment on many recent posts:
***************************************************

Lately I've seen the word "quack" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or
doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical
subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say "quack-quack" and
somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over
on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach
you in medical school - how to throw your authority around?

Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  "quack" is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.
The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming
from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real
scary.

But what do I know, I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this
newsgroup as being 'anal retentive', and 'psychotic'.  I look forward to more
net.diagnoses.  Hey, they're free.


Jon "Quacks 'R Us" Noring


(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories, such as the "yeast theory", should create your own moderated group.
You can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you
can keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)

Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size
of Zterm via ResEdit. He did not tell me HOW I could change it using
ResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.

Could he or any one else please tell me what to do?

I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, and
I have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correct
resource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play around
a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port.
(other than Appletalk).

BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is
3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are
using hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo,
and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond
3074 (out of 4096) bytes. Makes sense to me.

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to
read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.

Here is a simplified way of looking at it:
The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The
second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still
exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal'
drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all
data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last
directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not
taking multiple directories into account.

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

Jim,

I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at
least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of
the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to
validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,
then virtually nothing is known of the first century.

You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it

has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of
atheism.

That's completely inaccurate.  The ohm was an original standard made equal
to a the resistance of a standardized electric stove heating element.  That's
where the song "Ohm on the Range" came from, of course.

Subject: Radar detector DETECTORS?
Organization: Virginia's Public Education Network (Richmond)
Lines: 50

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?
  Are any brands "quieter" than others?

An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the
balanced low-Z output, but this solution does not provide any
galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and
mixer. If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap,
crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated,
the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (It is
cheap...somewhat $10/DI-box).
Not sure, but Craig Anderton did introduce one DI-box project
in Guitar Player mag years ago (transformerless).....

similar software, to input recorded sound into my Mac? I'm trying to play
some
very short interview clips in a HyperCard stack.

Thanks for any and all help.

                          An Introduction to Atheism
                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>

This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some
relevant books are listed in a companion article.

To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped
up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.

Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions
posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect
questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians
who proselytize on alt.atheism.

So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as
Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine
being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it
may not.

"What is atheism?"

Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.
Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is
often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong
atheism".

It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak
atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong
atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".

Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their
atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making
flat-out denials.

"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"

Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe
it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to
believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or
not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.

"What is agnosticism then?"

The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the
Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who
disclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things
must be some cause unknown and unknowable.

Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for
sure whether God exists.

Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that
you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact
that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people
use agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only when
referring to "strong atheism".

Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, it
is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for
sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't
the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out
about the universe.

"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"

There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a
particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.

Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions
is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that
such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they
see no evidence that God exists.

"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"

There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is
quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than
all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects
obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly
well-defined is a matter for debate.

However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably
impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of
God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to
show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.

If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in
question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid
may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing
might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is
often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest
primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.

Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist
unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of
the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively
prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.

To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be
tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to
prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by
default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.

Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God
exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover
varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it
may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be
possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious
book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described
by any present-day religion exists.

In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very
close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different
that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of
God are not really applicable.

"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"

If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction
must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be
detectable.

If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he
does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue
that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no
importance whether he exists or not.

If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.
Surely he should still be detectable today?

Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically
verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some
effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him
from all the other things that don't exist?

"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but
 isn't it still a religious belief?"

One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "the
redefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:

Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out
that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the
statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He
then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to
it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", but
uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure
redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen
to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.

The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn't
atheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by
"religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman
controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and
worship.

[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not
  "religion" according to such a definition. ]

Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it
categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of
"religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of
human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such as
science, politics, and watching TV.

"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is
 still just an act of faith, like religion is?"

Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one
actually believes in.

Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to
make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists
try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to
questioning if experience throws them into doubt.

Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally
assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are
the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called
"acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on
acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.

Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.
According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of
faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as
religious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not a
general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to
state with certainty that the universe exists.

Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.
Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism
has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as
even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or
the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.

"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"

It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or
"against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.

Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,
it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believers
speak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheists
have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.

This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.
Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.

Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, they
will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of
course, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" in
many countries.

A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" others
when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little
impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.

(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation
of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to
worship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about when
Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in
order to gain complete power over the population.)

Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see
religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,
the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that
church and state should remain separate.

"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,
 surely that's the same as state atheism?"

The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall
not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it
means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of
another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in
nature.

Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For
example, religious believers have historically been responsible for
encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations
campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as
religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,
and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists
are quite happy to see them have their say.

"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people
 pray?"

Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things
that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in
schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they
need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means
that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be
acceptable to all those present at any public event.

Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable
to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other
motives.

"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about
 atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't
 atheists object to the religious charities?"

There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can
contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for
the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work
for charities founded on a theistic basis.

Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in
connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday
matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say
self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set
of religious beliefs.

To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is a
rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not my
birthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.

"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against
 one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"

Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to
force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people
choose to call themselves atheists.

It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a
backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the
other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the
expectations of others.

On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are
backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go
along with a group rather than act or think independently.

"How do atheists differ from religious people?"

They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.

Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a
Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,
they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many
Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy
of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!

Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without
realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and
appearance.

"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"

That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course
atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one
talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable
("wrong") behaviour within society.

Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must
co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most
atheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposes
of self-preservation.

Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because they
feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care
what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.

Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to use
atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who
behave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their
actions.  For example:

  "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ
   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was
   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited
   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive
   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,
   be honor and glory forever and ever."

The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992
by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a
religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?

   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior
   deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents
   said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done
   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before
   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex
   before salvation; 5% after.
                                ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]

So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral
behaviour.

"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"

If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then the
answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality
which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.

If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answer
is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person
will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists,
but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by
humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather
than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.

"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"

A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the
atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for
them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible
with what they observed around them.

Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are
unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time
studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have
made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.

This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that
individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice
of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only
choice that person can honestly make.

"But don't atheists want to believe in God?"

Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many
of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the
"Big Brother" figure might be.

Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should
one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of
such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to
believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.

"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are
 unwilling in their souls to see!"

Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained
above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God
exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.

Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that
all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.
Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"
are likely to be viewed as patronizing.

Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is
vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are
being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not
willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is
futile.

"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"

Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives
meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives
count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other
people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to
political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.

It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in random
events.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thing
that has a "meaning".

To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually
a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is the
meaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup of
coffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.

"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"

There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.
Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.

That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so
what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or
should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?

In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are
unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because
it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider
that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just
hard luck.

"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"

The short answer is "No, do you?"

Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many
arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have
found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.

Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of
the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely
to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.

"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments
 apply?"

No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is
the sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism
is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.

Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs
because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,
but to everyone else.

"What sort of harm?"

Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not
just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;
think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.
Imagine how that effort could be better spent.

Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances
of ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines
prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died
because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.

It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and
condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many
third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.

Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than
allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different
religion.

"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some
 sort of excuse."

What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard
to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all
convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight
and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL
Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the
Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?

In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who
calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his
actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians
are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if
the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be
much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have
made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs
aren't a perversion of what your God intended?

If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why
should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?
Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered
others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a
Christian.

"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since
 nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely
 that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."

That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,
positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much
harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns
don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.

It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than
it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheists
would argue that asserting nothing is better still.

"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"

Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct"
it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology,
graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.

Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in
gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the
people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.

Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,
we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when
there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started
as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other
purposes as well.

"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say
 something?"

Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's
worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of
concept of God in the Christian sense.

Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's
rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.

"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded
 that God exists?"

For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who
does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is
not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to
realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the
same way that theists view their religious leaders.

A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but
when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many
respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on
subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.

"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates
 nothing?"

Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has
properties which have helped it so spread so far.

The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagate
themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view
religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by
encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by
discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure
to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some
religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by
other memes.

Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with
successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of
the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing
because of the number of people who have caught it.

"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important
 messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"

There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a
few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some
religions.

   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.

   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.

   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to
   find it.

   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.

   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.

   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change
   yourself.

   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.

   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.

   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.

and finally (and most importantly):

   All beliefs should be open to question.

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to
see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness
but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than
those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from
my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)
which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get
an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To
control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since
I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think
I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people
like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are
not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the
results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major
league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test
whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" -
but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in
said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major
leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure
whether I'd believe her.)

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or
dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or
sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of
intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam
freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming
up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis
of the problem first.  

Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something
that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,
but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the 
key elements in developing it.  

Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new
scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic
studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the 
theory of evolution.  

This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes
empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal
exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation
does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical
studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very
poor kind of science.

I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some of the
activities that lead to really important science --- namely thinking and
informal exploration --- are not recognized as scientific work.

the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so
that they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframe

To do this, I am thinking of using the SRGP package described in the
Van Dam, Foley and Feiner book, but I was wondering if there was
another PD graphics package out there which was faster.  I would like
to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides
satisfactory real time performance on a Sun IPX.

Ideally, I'm looking for a PD graphics package which will allow me to
open a new window under X, and allow me to draw lines within the
window.  Also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven
interaction handling since the user is going to move around the
wireframe models using the keyboard.

If you know or wrote such a package, I would be grateful if you could
direct me to a ftp site which contains the package.

Thank you.

If it were my wife, I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
process.  Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
other physicians aren't aware of.  Would you want a radiologist to
deliver your baby?  If you wouldn't, then why would you want a OB/GYN to
read your ultrasound study?


In my opinion the process should involve a OB/GYN and a radiologist.

Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the

Subject: Re: Is MSG sensitivity superstition?
Organization: USC  Department of Computer Science

Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to
restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts
to feel "puffy", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my
mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.

The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food
chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese
fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.

I am under the impression that MSG "enhances" flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.

Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)
involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is
what I suspect as being the cause.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals
showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab
rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.

Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied
they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder
of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the
tobacco companies still deny).

	I just bought a copy.  I can't disagree that it is a very good
book.  But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature
described in this book but _NOT_ in 640x480x16 or 320x200x256 mode. It
is easy to accomodate all the pixel "descriptor" (or color attributes)
in those modes into A0000-AFFFFF, but not in 640x480x256(which is what
I am interested in).  I haven't finish the book but I affraid the
author didn't talk much about this mode(or other SVGA modes).  If
anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics
manupulation(scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff..) please
send me mail.  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome.

	Thanks in advance.

Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the

certainly uses a 68HC000, according to the footnotes in the Supra ad. It

It's called the Supra 28, or Supra Turbo 28.
There's an external A500 model, and an internal A2000 model.

BTW, does anyone know if a 28Mhz 68HC010 exists?

I need to get the translation into English (when there is one) of the
following words. They refer to medical categories of operating rooms
(theaters). I admit they may not be universally "used".

Does anyone know if there are any devices available for the Mac which
will increase the number of serial ports available for use
simultaneously?  I would like to connect up to 8 serial devices to my

If such a device exists, are there are any limits to the number of

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces
on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,
the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'
"Reference Data for Engineers," seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims
in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...

    width   Temp rise
    inches  degrees C
    ------  ---------
     .125	100
     .15	 75
     .17	 60
     .20	 45
     .24	 30
     .33	 20

At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.
Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes
up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20" (~5mm) traces should be 
ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the 
required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08" width myself, 
I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is
a transient or fault condition.)

(There's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough?
But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or
just the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separate
sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)

I think that domestication will change behavior to a large degree.
Domesticated animals exhibit behaviors not found in the wild.  I
don't think that they can be viewed as good representatives of the
wild animal kingdom, since they have been bred for thousands of years
to produce certain behaviors, etc.

This problem is usually a low +5 Vdc from the power supply, there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply. If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR20.

	A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically
every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme
tiredness followed by:

	1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,
	knees, and hips.
	2. generalized muscle pains
	3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears
	4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day
	5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral
   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She
        isn't diabetic--they checked.
	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone
	   poles do not appear to be straight)
	7. loss of peripheral vision.
 	
	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something 
called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only
thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At
times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg
the symptoms become acute again.

	She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming
worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she
has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop
it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in

The above is probably not the most representative paragraph, but I
thought I'd hop on, anyway...

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's
fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation
than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is
that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he
had the free will to "choose" evil.  But where did that choice come
from?

We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a
tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover,
invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God
had not given origin to?

Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will?
We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me
as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like
salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.

At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly
coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...

Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had
perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an
act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to
exist for the first time?

Could be better caching on the disk.
Could be faster coil for seeks.
Could be that the disk spins faster so data transfers faster.
Could be that data is packed tighter so it transfers faster.
Could be a faster SCSI command decoder in the drive.

I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no
  amp which can touch it at the price range.
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.
If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each
  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east
  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant.
I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with
  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.

My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new.

If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.

Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.

Subject: Adapter Cable for VGA Monitors
Lines: 51

Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to
Apple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's
160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does
not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into
the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.

Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??

The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming
that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);


Macintosh LC to VGA
 
The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA
monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to
16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported
to 256 colors.
 
Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level
          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work
          with the Macintosh LC.
 
To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable
from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the
pinout description for the adapter cable:
 
Macintosh LC        VGA
Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name
---------------     ----    -----------
1                   6       Red ground
2                   1       Red video signal
5                   2       Green video signal
6                   7       Green ground
9                   3       Blue video signal
13                  8       Blue ground
15                  13      /HSYNC
12                  14      /VSYNC
14                  10      HSYNC ground
7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together
 
VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC
video connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which
results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA
monitor.

Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something 
I say can't be all bad.  ;-)

Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  
I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science 
is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your 
contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed "scientific" 
can possibly know what's true and what's not.

Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees 
of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully 
controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the 
extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain 
treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even 
if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that
a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for
from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.
In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible
but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are
qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.

SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of 
evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  


I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a
mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and
occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much
of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as
informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years
now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to
just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of
the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for
the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the
NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from
subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of
scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the
*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific
investigation.

Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If this
hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical
research then it can't be of any interest to us."  

To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "There've got to
be controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the Fast
Phobia/Trauma Cure.

Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most 
important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that 
it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell 
when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple 
visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that
it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is
useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially
a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral
therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once
(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The
process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to
practice it over again at home.

Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. 
(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  
Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up 
to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 
minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to 
the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a 
few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term 
follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view 
even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, 
there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best 
of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed 
after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done
with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast 
Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th
floor of my building and having a large balcony.)  

The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to
make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study
will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, 
many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill 
afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because 
the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the
scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain 
from scientific acceptance.) 

The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical 
psychology establishment is still saying "We don't have any way of 
knowing that it's effective."  

These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate 
as anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove your 
theory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim."  
One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely 
unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't 
been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of 
books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much 
detail as I'm capable of.)  

Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with 
favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a
doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.

To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  
This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire" 
attitudes about science.  

Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  
If so, I apologize.

  No, that's praying on the young.  Preying on the young comes
  later, when the bright eyed little altar boy finds out what the

I need to find a UART that will interface to an 8051 and do the following:
	-250k baud, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, no parity
	-ability to do BREAK detect (IRQ or output pin)
	-IRQ on character received

I'm using a Dallas DS2250 at 16 Mhz (8051 clone), but it won't do 
break detect.  I've looked at the 6850, 8251, 7201, 2661, etc...

	Any help would be appriciated!!!
